	<p>Hi 5X! Elizabeth's husband Paul here. I grabbed a video of your second race on 6/28/14.

	</p>
	<p>The download should start as soon as you click the link. If it doesn't start, you can also try right-clicking
		(ctrl-clicking on a Mac) and choosing Save As.</p>
	<p>Be patient: the download will take a minimum of 5 minutes and possibly much longer. The video file is about 125 MB.
