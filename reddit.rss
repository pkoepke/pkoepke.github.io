In “normal” years it’s still expected to see a lot of students get this harsh wake up call that university is more challenging and showing up to class is the minimum required to succeed. So we get students who had 4.0’s in high school trying and maybe not getting an A all the time, which is OKAY but they’ve been conditioned to think it’s not. Or we have people who show up and just don’t know how to study at all and struggle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly this year I’d have expected our students to not have this learning curve since presumably they’ve been forced to learn independently through the pandemic, and some clearly have, but most of them this year are really struggling. It’s on them though, i can only teach them the best that i can and give them independent help when they ask for it, but they mostly don’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they fail they either have to retake it or change their major.

For me personally, I was in my senior year and found it easier to learn the material because I could take the time I needed to sit and absorb what was in the lectures. The online structure was far more suited to how I learn and a big factor of this played into the disability accommodations I had. Sitting for a lecture with 100 other students was so distracting to me when class was in-person that I couldn&amp;#39;t focus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I am working on my Masters from a school that offers an online option in parallel to their in-person program. My grades have never been better and all of my work consists of papers that require original thought. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I would have to argue that for some students, being given a quiet space to learn material when you aren&amp;#39;t crammed in a lecture hall struggling to hear or see what is happening, allows those students to finally thrive in academics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;</content><id>t1_huchjvg</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sd9ewg/study_college_student_grades_actually_went_up_in/huchjvg/"/><updated>2022-01-26T20:57:44+00:00</updated><title>/u/wys9849 on Study: College student grades actually went up in Spring 2020 when the pandemic hit.

I am at a top-tier university, and the sheer lack of coordination and pedagogical support from Spring 2020-Spring 2021 was absolutely shocking; I didn&amp;#39;t receive a single hour of mandatory online training, and the optional sessions were run by people clearly as inexperienced as I was at teaching online.

We taught labs online through Summer 2021 and it was so pointless. In my opinion, labs are 25% reinforcing concepts from lecture and 75% learning basic lab techniques. If you’ve never touched a round bottom flask, watching a video of your TA doing the experiment really isn’t going to teach you much. The students learned nothing and everyone ended up with an easy A especially because we also got rid of exams fall 2021 because it was too hard to give them online (I was a TA, not my choice). It seems crazy students were paying full tuition for the course. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spring 2020 was just its own mess entirely. My college serves a lot of low-income students and some just didn’t have access to computers, internet, or places to study. I had one student who was homeless (he was on a friends couch) but he didn’t have a computer and while he could get most of what we wanted done on his phone he had no wifi. What’s someone supposed to do in that situation? Luckily, after a month my school did give laptops and hot spots to students but I had so many students behind at that point. We let them go back and do the work they could get to but they were playing catch-up for all of their classes. It was confusing for everyone. We had 3 hour TA meetings 2-3 times a week to try and figure everything out and everyone was still feeling a little helpless. We ended up with some crazy curve at the end of the semester, I think it was 20 points or so and almost all of my students ended up with an A, more than half an A+, because it just seemed unfair to penalize students for things out of their control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;</content><id>t1_huc2g8r</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sd9ewg/study_college_student_grades_actually_went_up_in/huc2g8r/"/><updated>2022-01-26T19:28:39+00:00</updated><title>/u/chestercat2013 on Study: College student grades actually went up in Spring 2020 when the pandemic hit.

They declined and gave themselves a 20% raise. Keep in mind that the administration are paid 2x+ of professors. For every raise they rewarded themselves with could have hired a professor, even if just adjunct. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s when it was solidified to me that universities are corrupt.

Basically teachers knew that with an increase in unexpected illnesses, quarantine requirements, shifting work schedules, etc. that due dates needed more flexibility than they&amp;#39;d had in the past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think this could possibly explain why low income students benefitted more as well. Lower income students, who are more often required to work and help with family than their wealthier counterparts, have *always* been dealing with these kind of struggles, but now that wealthier people were also facing them, structures were put in place to account for that. No one wanted to fail you because you spouse had COVID and you had to help tutor your kid because *they* didn&amp;#39;t have in person instruction either all while helping make sure your elderly relatives had what they needed so they could stay home where it was safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: They also relaxed rules around how many classes you could take P/F rather than for a letter grade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;</content><id>t1_huc1dok</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sd9ewg/study_college_student_grades_actually_went_up_in/huc1dok/"/><updated>2022-01-26T19:22:18+00:00</updated><title>/u/Oops_I_Cracked on Study: College student grades actually went up in Spring 2020 when the pandemic hit.

Any exam questions given with the book will be there. I have to create new versions of questions for every term and can&amp;#39;t reuse any old ones. It may sound like I&amp;#39;m being lazy but creating original tests for each section every term and programming them into the online learning system takes hours of time I could be using bettering the course materials or helping students. For example, I&amp;#39;m giving a 15 question test soon. I teach 5 sections of a class. That means 5 separate tests each with 15 unique questions that aren&amp;#39;t on Chegg or similar sites. And I have to randomize questions so the students who cheat by sharing in a big group chat have a harder time. That takes about 4 to 5 hours to create and program in for each section. And then the absolute time suck of students who cheat so blatantly that I can&amp;#39;t ignore it... I will never judge a student in my class who is trying learn and struggling. But I will judge a student who gives the numerical answer that isn&amp;#39;t possible with the data I gave but their answer is the same as the similar question on Chegg or their friend&amp;#39;s test. And then when asked about it, the student swears they didn&amp;#39;t cheat. And the way to really piss me off is when the student doubles down and is outraged at the accusation. Look, Karen, I hate doing the paperwork for cheating. I&amp;#39;m not going to start the process unless I&amp;#39;m damn well sure I&amp;#39;m sure you cheated and have absolute proof. On an interesting note, my experience is that the higher the level of the institution, the higher the likelihood of the student cutting through the crap and quickly admitting they cheated.
