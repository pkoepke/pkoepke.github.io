<br>
More or less, yeah. I took a stab at reading the nominees from last year's Sad Puppy slate, with the best open mind I could muster. I got through a few that didn't have openly misogynistic shit going down<sup>*</sup>, but were just... not good writing. I was left wondering why they were nominated — like, surely even right-wing reactionaries can put together a story that's not repetitive, going in circles, repetitive, etc.<br>
<br>
I'm mildly curious to see if this year's Sad Puppies are any better in terms of basic storytelling. <br>

Voting is using IRV, where you rank whichever of the nominees plus no award. Any you leave off and do not rank are tied for last. Also whoever wins in any given category is specifically counted against No Award and has to win in a runoff using all the ballots. I'm not great at explaining this.<br>

		<a name="5997291"></a><div class="comments">Torgersen's moronic analogy about how SF is no longer the SF he grew up with:<blockquote>We’ve been burning our audience (more and more) since the late 1990s. Too many people kept getting box after box of Nutty Nuggets, and walking away disappointed. Because the Nutty Nuggets they grew to love in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, were not the same Nutty Nuggets being proffered in the 2000s, and beyond.</blockquote>

So I don't know what he was reading in those years but I'm in my fifties and I grew up in the '70s and '80s reading Varley, Moorecock, Delany, Le Guin, Russ, Disch, etc. You have to do some pretty serious rewriting of history to pretend that SF dealing feminist, gay and gender issues haven't been around at least half a century.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18117" target="_self">octothorpe</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997291" target="_self">5:01 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

<br>
The Hugos are a slightly unusual award in that anyone who buys a supporting membership to WorldCon is allowed to vote in them. So... a cabal of shitty writers who, in their own words, are dedicated to fighting the "SJW glittery hoo ha crowd," figured out that they could game the award by getting friends, family members, random misogynists online, etc, to buy supporting memberships and stack the ballot in their favor. So they proceeded to do this. <br>
<br>
It's stupid and ridiculous and mock-worthy but it kinda hurts too. I had work that was eligible this year, many many of my friends had work that was eligible, and instead of a celebration of the most popular and memorable work among fans it's just this political stunt that is painful to observe. And not only is the ballot filled with remarkably unremarkable work, it also happens to be the most uniformly male selection we've seen in quite some time. There's really no mistaking their message: Women aren't welcome in science fiction.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/219232" target="_self">the turtle's teeth</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997293" target="_self">5:05 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

		<a name="5997307"></a><div class="comments">I have some sympathy for the "Puppies" argument. As a white, straight, Western man, I can freely speak for my fellow SF readers: we got into this as teenagers because of the spaceships, explosions, and adventure. The SF bit is quite tangential. <br>
<br>
Now, sure, there's lots of other stuff. But go and read some Atwood, Tiptree, Miéville: it's great, it addresses real questions about the human condition in the way that pulp "alien robot invasion" rubbish simply doesn't. However, it's fucking miserable and full of rape. I mean, have you read the Atwood MaddAddam series? It's brilliant, classic SF, exploring human societies at breaking point. It's also full of horrible sexual violence. <br>
<br>
We don't want to read that. We want to have escapism and fun. We don't care about science: if we did, we wouldn't read "science" fiction that ignored biology, psychology, economics, and indeed physics (there are NO FTL DRIVES. There will NEVER BE FTL DRIVES. They are as scientific as sparkly vampires. Which are cool, by the way, I'm just contrasting with a genre that is "for girls", not "for boys" like SF.)<br>
<br>
Really, you could just go through traditional adventures stories and give them SF window-dressing, and we'd love it. You could take the Napoleonic War HORNBLOWER series and replace all the wooden frigates with spaceships, for example, and we'd buy the shit out of it. Oh, wait, someone did, and Wikipedia tells me the series is up to 13 books and some spinoffs!<br>
<br>
The science is there to appease our identities as grown-up, Western, post-Enlightenment gentlemen, not actually make us face the realities of what science tells us about how humans behave and the universe works: <em>that's</em> no fun. Robots! Pretty girls! The ability to get in a spaceship and fly away from all the bosses/school bullies/mean co-workers, to somewhere where you are special and important! That's what we want from SF. Not <em>feminism</em>, or <em>science.</em> <br>
<br>
So why don't we just say so?<br>
<br>
The problem, of course, is that - identity politics again - we're not women, we can't just <em>like something,</em> it has to be <strong>Important</strong> and <strong>Applauded</strong> And <strong>Recognised.</strong> Women can read romance novels quite happily, they don't get all outraged all the time that people don't take "their" escapist genre seriously (or they know it'd be futile, I suspect...). But being white men, <em>our</em> genre has to be accorded respect, even though <em>we don't like lost of the actual good SF writers because they aren't any fun.</em> We're in a corner because the actual good SF - fiction that explores science and the human condition - isn't what we want to read!<br>
<br>
So we see white men mucking about with things like awards because we're stuck: our genre is inescapably sexist, heteronormative, Western and silly: when it isn't we don't want to read it, or admit it to the club, because it isn't any fun for us to read. But we won't admit that it's just "adventure stories with robots" because we like to make a claim to universalism (we think of ourselves as the universal norm, after all!) so we paint ourselves into a corner when universal stories - like, ones featuring the majority of humankind instead of us - come along.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18770" target="_self">alasdair</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997307" target="_self">5:15 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

But the first set was about prejudice and exploitation too ... it just celebrated the winners. Or, you know, were just Christopher Columbus hero stories ... with interstellar trappings.<br>
<br>
The "win" for these guys seems to be successfully destroying the Hugo's ability to recognize excellence in SFF, thus driving consumers and media to a competing award with better judgment, thereby successfully further marginalizing and reducing demand for their own He-Man space-boy pulp by undermining the market and highlighting the low quality of its products and the negative PR from being associated with it. <br>

It makes me sad. In the middle of Powell's books sci-fi section is a big column, and on that column is a hand-painted list of all the Hugo award winning novels since the beginning of the awards. I remember wandering in there at age, oh, 17, and saying "wait, four of those books are really good; I should read the rest". And so ever since I've read a couple of Hugo winners a year. Not too fast, I don't want to use all the good sci-fi too quickly.

I suppose that depends on how you define Hugo-caliber. There are a lot of dimensions to writing quality -- plot, characters, setting, writing style, politics -- and there's no rule that I have to consider plot and writing style enough to get past things that are not awards-worthy on other levels.<br>

(That said, I haven't read his work, but I can't see why his horrifying ideas alone couldn't disqualify him from being awards-worthy.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997326" target="_self">5:34 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

<br>
I don't intend it as a defence, but an explanation. We benefit from being the dominant culture: it comes at the expense of other cultures, to a greater or lesser extent. We do not wish to be reminded of this in our entertainments, but instead to be reassured that we are good people and that our culture is superior. When SF "fails" to do this we feel betrayed and hostile. <br>
<br>
That our culture's genre fiction makes claims to be universalist - the "science" bit - puts us in a particularly cognitively-dissonant position: one way to do this is to assert that the fiction we don't like isn't "really" SF and to attempt to drive it out of our genre classification so it stops annoying us. I suspect this is what we are seeing here.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18770" target="_self">alasdair</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997338" target="_self">5:44 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

Me too, and exactly. I definitely read and watch formulaic predictable stuff, but I can't imagine trying to claim any of it is superior to deeply thought-out innovative works. I certainly can't imagine doing so as an author. "My work doesn't make you think!" is not -- or shouldn't be -- a selling point. The fact that he thinks it is a selling point seems a huge indicator of how skewed his thinking is.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/162801" target="_self">jaguar</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997349" target="_self">6:02 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

I am just a crotchety old man or does anyone else think this is much ado about nothing? And my "nothing" I mean the Hugo Awards themselves. I've been reading SFF since the '70s and I've never once bought a book because it was nominated for or won a Hugo. I just never could take any type of industry awards seriously because they always involve politicking, promotion and general handwashing/backscratching. Every time I think I might pay attention to some type of award I remember that Jethro Tull beat out Metallica for a Grammy for best Heavy Metal album and I come to my senses. Besides, if these guys created their own awards they would be hard pressed to create a more phallic trophy than the Hugo without chrome plating an actual dildo.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16288" target="_self">MikeMc</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997369" target="_self">6:29 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

<br>
Going forward, I'm not sure how we'll manage to work out ways to prevent this form of politicization from spreading -- changing the voter pool is difficult, as it's linked to the cost of a Worldcon supporting membership, which in turn is effectively <a href="http://www.wsfs.org/bm/const-2014.html">legislated</a> to be about 1/4 the price of a full membership; $40 in recent years. Unlinking the voter pool from that would be a significant change for the Hugos, no matter how it's done.<br>
<br>
And oh, in case you were wanting to help any such change come along, to do so you'll need to attend in person the World Science Fiction Society's business meeting at a Worldcon, which this year is in <a href="http://sasquan.org/">Spokane, Washington</a>.<br>

Absolutely! Contemporary literary discourse is pathetically beholden to award culture. Great books don't need the validation of an award to be read - they just need passionate readers championing them. A healthy, diverse, democratic literary culture should more or less ignore the silliness of awards altogether. I just wish newspapers could learn to write about interesting progressive SF on its own merits, not just when an award makes it 'newsworthy'.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12959" target="_self">RokkitNite</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997374" target="_self">6:37 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

It's totally possible that you have never personally been influenced by awards, but they do kind of matter for marketing. For instance, libraries buy stuff that wins (or even is nominated for) awards, and bookstores often put award-winners on a table or display.  Publishers will be more inclined to put money and other sorts of muscle behind award winners. Awards generate buzz, even if people aren't necessarily aware that's why the buzz is there.<br>
<br>
I absolutely agree, though, that everyone should continue (and step up) their efforts to talk about books they love.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/190119" target="_self">ArbitraryAndCapricious</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997378" target="_self">6:41 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

		<a name="5997379"></a><div class="comments">The sad things is that if they weren't such ass-butts I might be able to agree with (or at least debate) some of their points. I look back over Hugo awards of past years and I generally think to myself "Damn, those are some classics of SF" and perhaps the winners now <em>aren't</em> quite as good. Or maybe I'll be proven wrong in 20 years. Or, you can look at the Hugo awards and say that good writers are being overlooked, but it's not like that hasn't been the case in the past (Douglas Adams? Terry Pratchett? Iain Mother Fucking <em>Banks</em>?) and it's not clear that politics had anything to do with it (Adams, Pratchett, and MF-Banks).<br>
<br>
But there are two problems. First, they are total dicks about it. Second, the sad puppies slate just wasn't that good. I thought that The Chaplain's Legacy from last year was okay. Vox Day's contribution, OTOH, was just shit writing. I wasn't truly blown away by any of the short story candidates, but his was terrible. The rest (of the ones I read) were better, but still weren't all that impressive.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/108265" target="_self">It's Never Lurgi</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997379" target="_self">6:43 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

		<a name="5997386"></a><div class="comments">Speaking as someone who started as a teen reading SF mainly written by white men and full of "spaceships, explosions, and adventure," I would argue that the SF was not "tangential."  I read it in large part for the sense of awesome wonder and discovery, the way plot and ideas were inextricable, twists and revelations one and the same.  It was a straight shoot from Niven to Gibson to LeGuin, Delaney, Tiptree, Mieville.  Each was doing exactly what I'd originally gotten into SF for: blowing your mind, upending the world as you knew it, and delivering discovery in a gripping plot full of strange new things and ideas.  One naturally outgrew Niven after finishing his stuff and wanting more.  The idea of going back in time, or settling into some deliberately self-stultified genre that replicates indefinitely what what white male writers in the 50s-70s were up to would be anathema to what I as a teen was after.  The whole point of the "nutty nuggets" I loved as a teen was that you never knew what would be in each box, and in fact the best ones redefined what "nutty nuggets" even meant.  Expecting the same exact experience decade after decade is not just immature, it's a bizarre repudiation of everything that SF is most fundamentally about, and I would argue, a repudiation of what a lot of the people who espouse it actually got into SF for in the first place.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/80062" target="_self">chortly</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997386" target="_self">6:53 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

Yes! Yes! Yes!

		<a name="5997398"></a><div class="comments">Thank you, chortly, for writing exactly the comment I was coming down here to make.  I'm not sure who the "we" in alasdair's comment is.  But this particular woman who got into SF as a very young teenager was never in it for the adventure to the exclusion of the SF.  Neither is more important than the other to me.  I loved those white straight male writers and their spaceships, sure - but they were never all I loved and the way you describe it is not SF as I recognize it or have ever experienced it.<br>
<br>
SF is not "for boys."  SF is not exclusively for you.  SF is for everyone. SF is mine.  It has always been mine from the first SF novel I picked up.  More importantly, it belongs to today's teenage girls, and will belong to today's little girls when they're a bit older,  and part of SF belonging to me is a responsibility and a desire to keep it for them when they are ready to discover it.  I might cede it for my own sake because I'm getting old and tired of fighting the same damn fights, but for their sake, I will never, ever cede SF to the sole care of boys.<br>
<br>
But hey, the flip side of this? Fantasy isn't "for girls"!  If you don't know that yet, then I am happy to tell you there is a world of amazing fantasy books out there.  You can have them.  The young men in your life can have them.  Those worlds are for everyone too.

LOVED IT.  I read it twice in six months.  It's lovely.  Full of interesting world-building and beautiful character moments, and human warmth (although none of the characters are actually human).  <br>

What it does that's so original is hard for me to pin down, but it's really a wonderful little novel, and nothing like the author's other work (it's no secret she published a number of other well-respected novels as Sarah Monette).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997407" target="_self">7:23 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

With all due respect, what do you mean "we", kemosabe?<br>

Science fiction, going back to its roots, is about <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164">scientific advances</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35">challenging ideas</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84">profound philosophical themes</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17157">provocative satire</a>, <a href="http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/newcastle/blazing/blazing.html">boundary-pushing exploration</a>, and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32">diversity</a>.  It's past time for that heritage to be embraced again.<br>
<br>
The so-called "Golden Age of Sci-Fi" of pulp magazine exploits and paperback adventures was only a phase in the genre.  Sure, it was fun while it lasted, but it's not to everyone's taste by a long chalk.  Today, though, the Sad Puppies are clinging to it like adolescents who refuse to grow up and instead act out in antisocial misbehaviour.<br>

It's hard to believe that in this century we have this many spoiled little pencil-dicks that are afraid of ladies and POC. What the hell kinds of kids have people been raising in the last twenty years. The Hugos have an enormous mess to clean up and frankly I don't know how they will go about it. But this shit has to stop and stop now. We can't afford to let these He-Man-Woman-Hating little rascals do this again. Damn, I've got a lot of "no award" votes to give this year.<br>

Another thing, if they get this riled up about getting vagina in their science fiction, what kind of vitriol and bile will these children be spewing next year when Clinton makes her run for the presidency?

Pink SF primarily concerns a) choosing between two lovers, b) being true to yourself, or c) enacting ex post facto revenge upon the badthinkers and meanies who made the author feel bad about herself at school. Pink SF is about feelings rather than ideas or actions.<br>

Pink SF is an invasion. Pink SF is a cancer. Pink SF is a parasitical perversion. Pink SF is the little death that kills every literary subgenre.

<br>
So it's not that science fiction about different races or genders or sexualities haven't been part of the genre since the Before Times. It has - look at Heinlein, or Asimov, or a host of others. Hell, Heinlein even had essentially  a trans character. But when these stories came up, it was obvious the authors were just playing with ideas. These things didn't matter deeply or personally, and honestly because of that, they didn't permeate very deep. The character was solo and their world was...very normative. It didn't disturb the world consensus. Same with diverse authors - they generally wrote roughly similar stuff as the others, and were welcomed in the boy's club. And everyone was congenial and friendly and went to the same parties and didn't rock the boat. And the old boys never said "We don't want those guys here." They were the beloved elders and could expect to progress along a track to eccentricity. <br>
<br>
And then came new people who were pissed off at the patronizing boy's club, and who didn't care for them as mentors and didn't want to go to their parties or pander to their fans. And they didn't just want a token PoC - they wanted a world that was a big old Fuck You to the old lions.Often because of those very old lions. And so they wrote explicitly political Fuck Yous, and called the banners, and said, "The world is ours now, fuck your gatekeepers. "<br>
<br>
And there's a lot that's admirable there. But what's explicitly called for is the extinction of the world of the old lions. And it is not really surprising that they're fighting back.<br>
<br>
But it's not about keeping everyone different out. It's a fight, more than anything,  about who's going to be in charge and who will get to shape fandom.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997459" target="_self">8:33 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

<br>
So what you're saying is, if the oppressed and marginalized had JUST BEEN MORE POLITE about how they disliked being oppressed and marginalized, we wouldn't be having this problem?<br>
<br>
These writers are mostly Baby Boomers or younger. (I have found one born in 1940; the rest are younger by my unscientific quick googling). The oldest Baby Boomers were in college when Martin Luther King, Jr., was shot. They're not some "old lions" who grew up in the 30s and fought in WWII and went to segregated schools and have never quite adjusted to how the world has changed. <em>Brown v. Board</em> was 1954. The majority of these authors had not yet been born. These are people who grew up in a world where racism and sexism were already fallen apart -- or already HAD fallen apart. They have NEVER lived in a world where women don't go to college, or where "separate but equal" was okay. They are not people who are confused because the present they live in is too different from the world they grew up in; they are people explicitly demanding an oppressive, unequal past come back. "Vox Day" was born in 1968. 1968! He has literally no excuse! This is a guy who watched footage of Bull Connor in <em>history class</em> and apparently said, "Fuck this equality shit! I'm on Bull Connor's side!"<br>
<br>
The world of the old lions was already extinct. Apparently what they want to do is buy up all the land the lions lived on prior to 1968 and turn it into a nature preserve with reintroduced bigots, to protect the species from extinction.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997475" target="_self">9:00 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

<br>
Let's rephrase that as "people who were tired of being literally ignored as writer, readers, and characters in the field; of being manhandled at conventions by the Old Lions; of being used as plot-tokens and pieces of exotic color in fiction; and of being verbally abused, talked over, and ignored in person and online."  <br>
<br>
The "patronizing boys' club" did far worse than <i>patronize</i>.  And don't mistake it: there is significant philosophical overlap between the Sad Puppies and the Gamergaters--and in fact, actual overlap, since Torgerson reached out to them to punish women and people of color for daring to win Hugos in the last five years.<br>

I suspect Torgensen is smart enough to know that Roddenberry's <em>Trek</em> espoused humanist values. But this whole enterprise is about taking the (surface-level) language of the excluded and turning them to serve those who are already included. "We just want a seat at the table," et cetera. Casting <em>Trek</em> as a conservative icon that the scary boogeywomen are gonna take away is just another tactic to serve that strategy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997488" target="_self">9:39 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

And so?  I didn't get that from the book, although I didn't love it as much as many of my friends did. I don't think there's anything wrong in saying, "This field doesn't appear to respect or value me or the things I love, and I'm going to write something that includes me and the things I love."  What's wrong with that, exactly?  <br>

Given the next season coming up, I assume it was thrown together quickly. But it's so obviously just the list of fantasy authors the writer happens to have read that aren't the subject (GRRM) and are famous enough to be recognized. Rowling, course, doesn't get mentioned by name because her work is "just" children's fiction (as if a lot of Gaiman's work isn't also). It's pretty telling, though, that C.S. Lewis IS mentioned (despite also being a children's author) but then he's more acceptable to the old guard.

OK, Matthew David Surridge says he has only written a couple of stories, but one of them is "The Word of Azrael," collected in one of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1607012561/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="1607012561">Rich Horton's anthologies</a>.

A <a href="http://www.blackgate.com/fiction-excerpt-%E2%80%9Cthe-word-of-azrael%E2%80%9D/">brief excerpt</a> gives a fair idea what I mean, but it's better at full length.

I assume this is a reference to David Weber's <i>Honor Harrington</i> series (unless there are <em>two</em> Hornblower-in-space series? That is certainly not impossible...), and while it is certainly, and I think self-consciously, somewhat lowbrow, space-doesn't-actually-work-this-way SF—I mean at one point in the series the spacefaring civilization that is a transparent stand-in for France has a revolution, and the demagogue's name is, and I am not making this up, <em>Rob S.

I've not read any of the Sad Puppy candidate books, but if I were to imagine what I suspect Gamergater types want in their SF, I'd think that it's more along the lines of John Ringo than David Weber.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36800" target="_self">Kadin2048</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997507" target="_self">10:17 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

Yes, some of it (Octavia Butler for ex) can be extremly grim stuff. But Ursula LeGuin has written many funny stories. Connie Willis' stories are almost always funny. Suzie McKee Charnas' story "Boobs" deals with sexism but is also blackly humorous about the ways a girl who turns into a werewolf might take her revenge on her tormenters. I know there are others out there I'm just not thinking of.

As a reader it's always seemed like SF was the place where alternative perspectives were preferred, where every kind of person was welcome and encouraged to contribute, that was the whole point. Maybe there was a brief period of manly alien thumping but even Heinlein got freaky by the 70s. The world of imagination is endless--true fans of that freedom have always been welcoming to new voices exploring new spaces. Whatever pure tradition these assholes think they're defending I don't believe that it actually exists.

The beautiful thing about the genre is that it's so wide open we can that have it all. Righty, lefty, straight Christians, gay space raptors, apolitical shoot 'em up space opera, whatever. The sky isn't even the limit it's just where the story begins. The battle seems to be for the awards ballots and the hearts and minds of the "fandom", I'm thinking you win that battle by writing good stuff, quality <em>should</em> win out in the end.

		<a name="5997554"></a><div class="comments"><em>I just want to speak up here to contest the idea that SF written by/featuring women, POC, transpeople, etc., can't be fun. What? </em><br>
<br>
Agreed! To add to your list, Ursula Vernon, who won a Hugo a few years ago for her comic Digger and was on the nominee ballot this year for <em>Toad Words</em> (T Kingfisher is her pseud), writes stuff that is frequently funny and light--hell, she makes most of her living as a freaking children's book author. <br>
<br>
Regarding why people get into sci-fi--look, insofar as I have any interest in sci-fi it's because I like to alter shit about the world and see what happens next to the culture, and I like to ground that in actual <em>science</em>. I don't necessarily give a shit about physics but I've read basically every sci-fi novel I've ever sought out because I wanted to know what authors thought might happen if, e.g., you <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/834670.Glory_Season">shifted human reproductive biology to be partially parthenogenetic</a>, or if maybe you ran into a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52397.Parable_of_the_Sower?from_search=true">culture which borrowed DNA from other species</a> as a matter of course. I want to know about what authors think about the ethics of cloning and of bioengineering humans, and I want to know about how interspecies differences in signaling systems impact communication, and I want to know how human population structure might change if all of humanity wound up on lifeships. I want to know how contraints on colony living change cultural structure and taboos in the people who live in those colonies, and I want to know that in the context of what we know about human behavior now. <br>
<br>
And because I am a biologist, because I am interested in the whole human species, I want to know what happens to people like me in those brave new worlds, too. I don't want a white future; I want to know what <em>all</em> of humanity is doing. I don't want a straight future, either, or a male one; I want to know how these tweaks would impact <em>all</em> kinds of people, and how it might change the way they think. I want to start from the counterintuitive realities of biology, of behavior, of <em>people</em>--the chaotic strangeness of life--and let those grow into a story. <br>
<br>
Then again, I'm not exactly the demographic these guys are coming from, either. Should I say "Ah, well, sci-fi ain't for me because I care too much about the science?" Or "ah, sci-fi isn't meant for me, I care way too much about the real world and the bits of it that aren't necessarily obvious to straight white men--or obvious to me?" Because from my perspective, the Golden Age stuff I've read is frequently narrow-minded or misses things that <em>I</em> find obvious, because my perspective is different. It would be a shame to miss out on stuff that jolts my worldview in interesting ways because I'm not paying attention to large swathes of people whose perspective is different from mine again.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/210518" target="_self">sciatrix</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997554" target="_self">11:57 PM</a>  on April 4, 2015

Just because not every sf book is one you enjoy, does not mean the majority are still not being written for you, the straight, white, male reader.  They are.  But we've taken a small share of the market and you're acting like its the end of all you hold dear. <br>

I, a bi, female, white reader, grew up on Heinlein, Bester, and Bradbury.  I saw myself represented exactly nowhere in the books, despite the fact that I loved the concepts and plots and the grandeur of space.  How dare you say that because I'm not a straight male, I'm relegated to an "other" that doesn't deserve what you've had your whole life? (Stories about people you can easily identify with.) And because you're finally getting a small taste of what the rest of us "others" have had to deal with our whole lives, you're complaining? Forgive me for not having any sympathy for you.<br>

<br>
<strong>Nobody gets to be in charge of fandom</strong>.  Nobody gets to shape it.<br>
<br>
No one is in control of dictating our tastes, and how they might evolve or change (or might not) for any fan.  <br>
<br>
Nobody gets to tell me what to like, what not to like, and what's ok.  That's the high school shithead bullying mentality that I, in part, turned to science fiction and fantasy to get away from - to be able to explore worlds and universes that didn't conform to the usual; where big ideas got explored; where the best stories dared me to see what change would be like, to imagine what it was like to be different, to see the world differently. Yes, part of it was about escape - but it was escape from a world where I felt stifled to ones where I felt free to explore possibilities.  A host of possibilities. <br>
<br>
This is supposed to be the literature of the BIG IDEA; of being open and seeing strange horizons and dangerous visions. To boldly go where no one has gone before.  To step out on the road, lose your footing, with no way of knowing where you might be swept off to.  You can't put fences around it; you can't say this belongs and that doesn't.  You can't say who belongs and who doesn't.  There are writers in SF&amp;F whose politics and personal views I detest; some of their books sit upon my shelves because I love how they write or the ideas they chose to explore.  And some of my collection is there because they are comfortable, safe, wonderful places for me to return to, again and again, when I need the feelings they evoke in me.  <br>
<br>
No one gets to try to tell me which worlds to explore and which to exclude.  <br>
<br>
When it comes to SF&amp;F:  All these worlds are ours, no exceptions.  Attempt all landings.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/179122" target="_self">nubs</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997581" target="_self">1:05 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

		<a name="5997582"></a><div class="comments">Reading back a bit, I don't get the idea that SF is "our" genre fiction or that SF in general was any worse than other genres, who had their own struggles with issues of diversity. Romance may have been a primarily female audience, but it had its own pulp publishers and gatekeepers analogous to Campbell. <br>
<br>
Other people have pointed out that romance is only romance if it involves a female author or perspective. For John Carter, James Bond, or Conan to get the girl doesn't seem to count. <br>
<br>
If things are coming to a head again, I suspect it's because between digital publishing of shorter works and blogging we don't have the same mass-market gatekeepers. That, and globalization is bringing together new science fiction communities together.  The 2013 Tiptree winner, Rupetta, was authored by an Australian, given an initial print run of a few thousand by an London specialty press, and more widely available by ebook before the awards were announced. (It is also an amazing novel.) <br>
<br>
<i>as if any videogame past maybe Pong is apolitical.</i><br>
<br>
And sometimes science fiction can be weirdly politicized. The 1983 V miniseries was banned in South Africa by "The Crocodile" because he thought the reptilian aliens were a reference to him.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997582" target="_self">1:06 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

I've been nominating and voting for the Hugos for years, and it's been obvious to me for a while how vulnerable the nomination process is to someone who wants to game the system. Last year, it took all of 43 votes to get a short story onto the ballot.  I'm not sure what can be done to reduce the effectiveness of a slate campaign while still letting fans choose the nominees/winners. I mean, there's no way to enforce people voting on the quality of the work rather than some political agenda.<br>

Because they need to be reassured that the reason they dominate the culture is because they're RIGHT, not because their ancestors were more warlike, brutal and cruel and therefore WINNERS. I have been frankly ashamed of being a white, straight, Western man for more than half of my adult life, and even before I figured it out, I was into SF, not for the outer-space-stuff, but for the FUTURE-stuff, the utopian and dystopian projections of the world far beyond my lifetime and ability to participate in it.

<br>
That's one of those received ideas that drive me up the wall. The long history of literature is filled with great political works (Tolstoy, Dickens, George Eliot, Victor Hugo, just to stick to Europe in the 19th Century) but suddenly in the 1980s it became a truism that politics was somehow foreign to literature. Lately there's been a discussion about whether the Iowa Writers' Workshop is to blame. But that aside, I think this casting out of politics is part of the reactionary conservatism that shook Western culture in the last two decades of the 20th Century. I'm not surprised it's now the respectable rallying cry of those who wish to prop up the power structures of wider, contemporary society.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997624" target="_self">5:05 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

Thing is ... the only thing I've read that was on the "Puppy" lists is Skin Game.  Now, there's nothing *wrong* with Skin Game.  It's fine.  I liked it.  But it doesn't merit a major award.  It doesn't merit being on the short list for a major award.  If Skin Game is the kind of thing that's on their list, then it's hard for me to buy that the argument they're making is "these brilliant works of great quality will be ignored unless we do something about it!"<br>

It's kind of telling that this year the only overlap between the Hugo nominations and Nebula nominations for written works are the two Hugo-nominated novels that *weren't* on the Puppy lists.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997637" target="_self">5:45 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

<br>
The SP and RP slate of nominees is gaming the system, and that is all it is. Whether or not any of the works on those slates could have made the Hugo shortlist on their own merits is moot. The supporters of SP and RP claim that past nominees and winners were beneficiaries of the same gaming, but this hasn't and can't be proved. This year, however, the gaming is obvious and provable. I feel any Hugos given out to SP or RP slate authors should have a little asterisk next to their name so that folks know that this was a year that some cheaters won.<br>

<br>
"In the last decade we’ve seen Hugo voting skew more and more toward literary (as opposed to entertainment) works ... ultimately lacking ... the kind of child-like enjoyment that comes easily and naturally when you don’t have to crawl so far into your brain ..."<br>
<br>
It's true that his other argument is that he doesn't like awards going to books written by or about women and minorities and queers and suchlike:<br>
<br>
"Worldcon and fandom alike have tended to use the Hugos as an affirmative action award: giving Hugos because a writer or artist is (insert underrepresented minority or victim group here) or because a given work features (insert underrepresented minority or victim group here) characters."<br>
<br>
But his line of thinking is not that awards should go instead to brilliant books by and about straight white men.  It is that the awards should go to relatively brainless action novels by and about straight white men.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997645" target="_self">6:24 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

<br>
It's almost bizarre how little relationship their supposed complaints bear to reality.  They yearn for the adventure stories of classic science fiction?  Let's look at the winners of the past few years.  (Warning - spoilers follow.)<br>
<br>
Ancillary Justice -- Classic space opera plot.  An AI hunts across space for an alien superweapon to use to take revenge against the galactic Emperor.<br>
<br>
Redshirts -- Direct riff on one of the most beloved classic sci-fi serials of all time.  A spaceship crew fighting impossible odds to survive. <br>
<br>
Among Others -- A book which is a love letter to classic science fiction.  Details the experience of growing up with these books, reading them, reacting to them, being a fan of them.<br>
<br>
So in recent years, the winners have been a book with a classic science fiction plot, a book which is a take on a classic science fiction serial, and a book which is about classic science fiction books.  Yes, truly the Hugos have lost sight of their past.  (Apparently because these books were written by two women and a liberal, and in one it's hard to tell which characters are the manly male men.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997653" target="_self">7:29 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

<br>
They appear to be under the impression that people who say they like the kind of work that has been winning Hugos lately are simply lying about their preferences, that people vote for things because they are SJW-approved and no other reason. (Which is odd, because I remember a lot of complaints about how Redshirts decided to take the All Men Plus One Woman Whose Major Personality Characteristic Was Femaleness (like Smurfette) rather too seriously. I don't think Among Others is particularly political, and going further back neither is Blackout/All Clear unless you believe that the Nazis were good. Of course 3 were written by women, 1 by a man they hate.)<br>
<br>
And also that people who would like True SF read the other work because it won awards and are therefore turned off the genre and so the genre is losing market share at a fast rate, so soon there will be no more science fiction of any sort published.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997668" target="_self">8:20 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

Still  from an ideological turing test perspective I think it is pretty easy to see why you might hate them if you are a conservative or redpill style internet troll or neoreactionary. They all have elements which are fairly explicitly affirmations of progressive politics, and in two cases, (Ancilliary Justice, which i loved, and Redshirts which I loved until the additional endings) I can see how they would seem tacked on  if you did not have the ability to understand the authors emotional perspective.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/130661" target="_self">Another Fine Product From The Nonsense Factory</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997671" target="_self">8:23 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

I mean, how much of the "classic" SF from the 60s and 70s contains the authors' libertarian blathering? How could you not notice it in Heinlein or Niven or Pournelle? The problem is that it's people who don't share their own politics getting recognition.<br>

I haven't read the follow-ups, but I enjoyed <em>Ancillary Justice</em> tremendously. As a fan of adventure SFF, I was glad it won the awards it did.

		<a name="5997681"></a><div class="comments">Yes, so the answer to this:<br>
<br>
<em>I just don't get this. How does someone writing a book you are not interested in reading detract from the ones that you do want to read, even if they are in the same genre? Why do all these racist misogynists even care?</em><br>
<br>
is this:<br>
<br>
<em>Because they need to be reassured that the reason they dominate the culture is because they're RIGHT, not because their ancestors were more warlike, brutal and cruel and therefore WINNERS.</em><br>
<br>
It's about identity. We none of us want to be The Bad Guys. So things that make us The Bad Guys are going to be resisted, whether threads on racism on Metafilter or SF with a feminist slant. <strong>Whether we are the bad guys or not.</strong> We don't want to think we are the bad guys, and we don't want to read stuff that makes us the bad guys.<br>
<br>
So what's the problem? We all just read the sub-genre that flatters us, right? That works perfectly until you get to... awards, which are supposed to define the genre. And here we are.<br>
<br>
A related tangent: the Culture books are great, a panhuman non-sexist society. Of course, none of the popular adventure stories are actually based in this society, which would be boring and be like a girly soap opera (which are great too, but not consumed by/intended for boys). They're about the straight white men (disguised or not) who have to deal with the natives, usually with lots of violence and derring do. Also, lefty right-on dudes get to be really violent towards nasty right-wing people. I mean, I love them, but let's not pretend they aren't a combination of wish fulfilment and adventure story.

[SPOILERS]<br>
<br>
EXCESSION: Race to get the alien artefact! (Also, the Culture Minds turn out to be just like normal macho military men (the scene where they throw out the Minds who aren't part of some unelected inner sanctum makes it particularly obvious, but also the breathless hard on for the huge ship that's become a vast battleship, oh and the oh-so-feminist Culture is fine with a pregnant woman getting stabbed for infidelity).<br>
<br>
LOOK TO WINDWARD: Will the tiger-man alien manage to blow up the Culture space station in revenge for the Culture fridging his wife?  (So not only "providing character motivation by fridging a wife/girlfriend" but also "it's okay to torture your enemies to death because they're bad people" - the "Culture terror weapon"). <br>

That's not how I remember the plot. I remember the macho idiot male protagonist going in his own merry way with the macho idiot aliens, tho.<br>
<br>
<em>the tiger-man alien</em><br>
<br>
I remember a six-armed badger alien and the book ending on a rather bromantic suicide pact between said alien badger and an AI, and not even one main character being human.<br>

I think I'm trying to say that making a white straight character into a computer or an alien or indeed a woman doesn't make the character not a white straight character, if that's how you otherwise write the character: there are many threads about white male authors  writing women and people of color that could explain what I'm alleging better.

		<a name="5997722"></a><div class="comments">Yeah, I take alasdair's argument to be: "Here's how a lot of SF looks from the perspective of the hegemonic identity. It's actually kind of despicable that that identity gets as much credit, attention, and representation in SF as it does."<br>
<br>
I don't see anything in what he's written here that is a defense of that identity except perhaps the kind-of-justification that this kind of escapist reading is fun and the really good books in SF sometimes are downers.(Because subaltern voices often focus on injustice and don't imagine happy endings.)<br>
<br>
He makes it clear at the top that giving awards for repetitive genre schlock when there's excellent challenging work by underrepresented voices is a terrible, terrible thing. So maybe try reading him with a little more charity.<br>

		<a name="5997776"></a><div class="comments">I really had no idea. Admittedly, I am not really a big consumer of modern fiction of any sort, mostly on account of being cheap, but wow.<br>
<br>
Over on the above linked Torgensen article, Baen Books and the <a href="https://www.baenebooks.com/c-1-free-library.aspx">Baen Free Library</a> (Helping me read books on my phone since I discovered it online in 2002) are mentioned more than a few times as the last place to get "good" scifi, archetypal adventure style or whatever. But as mentioned above, the <em>Hornblower</em> style Honor Harrington series is there (read the first two books free, maybe you'll buy the rest!), and the lead is a strong female, who wins with her brain, not looks, and has insecurities about herself and sometimes has to deal with misogyny and dare I say it, there are even subplots dealing with the horribleness and terror of rape; yet there is swashbuckling space adventure galore, and a story that holds you and keeps you turning the page. <br>
<br>
Even John Ringo, mentioned above, in <em>A Hymn Before Battle</em> and <em>Gust Front</em>, military scifi novels heavy on the military, has very strong female characters, and in amongst the alien slaying does some introspection on military families where both spouses serve, and how both wrestle with the sacrifices required therein, for the greater good, how sometimes the best way to keep your family safe is to leave them and go fight. Not everyone's cup of tea, sure, but not exactly He-Man Woman Haters Club stuff either.<br>
<br>
The one thing I find most positive about all this mess is the somewhat surprisingly (to me) large amount of emotional investment in the scifi/fantasy fiction world! As long as there is a fandom of interested and engaged readers and writers willing to try new stuff, I think we'll be okay.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/219833" target="_self">HycoSpeed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997776" target="_self">11:26 AM</a>  on April 5, 2015

All the authors agreed to be on the Sad Puppies list. Torgersen overlooked contacting three authors initially, and two asked to be removed (which they were.) One fan writer who was late to the kerfuffle <a href="http://www.blackgate.com/2015/04/04/a-detailed-explanation/">declined his nomination</a> (long, but thoughtful) once he realized he didn't agree with the project. So, they're all "guilty by association" the same way a political party is, and they should be prepared to be punished at the polls the same way a political party is. <br>
<br>
They've <em>already</em> made it about something other than quality by making it about party. If you want the party-politification to end the only way forward is to make running on a slate a defacto defeat.

Surridge (the fan writer) was aware of his inclusion, but says he didn't think it would amount to anything at the time, so his approval was de facto. It's possible others thought as he did, but I've yet to see anything similar. I'd be very surprised if anyone was on that list and not aware of it (at least for the literary categories.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/85311" target="_self">ChurchHatesTucker</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997832" target="_self">12:36 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

		<a name="5997887"></a><div class="comments">Those early greats of science fiction were, for example, calling themselves things like "The Futurians", and sixty, seventy years later we're supposed to want to keep reading more of exactly the same thing?  I can still enjoy Kornbluth because I have faith that if he'd lived long enough to see it, he would have been amazed and excited by the way the world changed in the 60s and 70s, to say nothing of today.  Frederik Pohl, by then in his nineties, was doing environmental activism on his blog in 2013 shortly before he died.  Like a guy who thought the future mattered.  They weren't just products of their time; they were trying to be better than that, even if they didn't always succeed.<br>
<br>
I think most of the greats would have found most of these writers completely appalling, if nothing else than being so stuck on the idea that change is bad and scary and traditions must be upheld at all costs.  The science isn't just in the gadgetry and the spaceships; the genre's always been about examining the world you live in today and theorizing about the world people will live in tomorrow.  If stuff written 50+ years ago didn't seem socially and politically regressive in places, then it would mean we hadn't actually made any progress.  I absolutely enjoy the classics, but anybody who's trying to use the sci-fi of decades ago as a model for writing today missed the point by a few light years.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175568" target="_self">Sequence</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997887" target="_self">1:40 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

The problem with positing a functional post-scarcity socialist utopia run by benevolent AIs is that the daily lives of most well-adjusted people living in it are probably pretty boring to anyone except themselves.  There's only so many pages you want to read about a bunch of people at the very top of Maslow's hierarchy inventing new hobbies and sexual positions.<br>

<br>
It turned out that I had $40 in my pocket that absolutely agreed with that statement. (I'd missed the nomination period and for some reason thought supporting memberships were not available after the nominations closed. I was, happily, wrong.) <br>
<br>
I'll be doing a variant of last year: I attempted to read everything, was not gripped by any of the SP nominations (go figure) but ranked them in a few categories. This year, I will do some homework to see for which authors on the slate there may be a question of knowing what they were agreeing to, and treat their works the same; the rest I won't attempt to read because I'm sorry, you gave up your right to be fairly considered when you didn't get on the ballot with fair consideration in the first place, and the slate organizers' stated aims are in fact antithetical to my very existence.<br>
<br>
<em>And</em> they invited in gumbogoobers to a space I'm not often in, but like to visit occasionally.  Nope.<br>
<br>
So the lowest slot in those categories will go to my friend Noah Ward, indeed. Sometimes the lowest slot may also be the first slot.<br>
<br>
(And question or not, I will not even look at anything by Wright, whose work I bounced off hard once, even before I learned about his blazing misogyny, and by "Day", because seriously now, there isn't enough NaClO. Hugos are supposed to be a popularity contest? They aren't popular enough with me.)<br>

Yeah, revanchist Catholics who somehow gain notice outside their small circles never do real well. They labor under the delusion that they are the only logical people in the world and if everyone else just read Aquinas! ... so it comes as a bit of a shock when other smart people who <em>have</em> read Aquinas still take them apart and think they're ridiculous.<br>

<small>(I have not read any John C. Wright but just from brief third-party biographical descriptions and a short summary of an argument he was involved in about modernity, I will BET YOU MONEY that when he talks about his rightness/other people's wrongness, he references Aquinas and rationality. <em>I know from revanchist Catholics.</em> They are very predictable.)</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997908" target="_self">2:21 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

Someone will run a social justice slate that crushes the nominations in the major categories and relegates the sad puppies back to the cheap seats. 2. There will be a concerted effort to change the rules in some way but I don't think it will succeed because many people would prefer to make the whole award political and the Hugo's are already struggling v the Nebulae. 3.Scott Lynch will be nominated for his next Locke Lamora book regardless of all the crap (this is purely my hope because I really want it to be super good!) 4. The social justice slate will be able to find a much more plausible "best novel" nominee and even most SF fans don't read much short fiction and will be accepted because of this. 5. Publishers won't be able to use "Hugo award nominated"  to give a few promising short fiction writers a book deal with some bank, which will deprive the world of at least 1 future book I would have loved to read . (5 is difficult to test and more of a moan but 1-4 are a decent calibration I should come back to next year).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/130661" target="_self">Another Fine Product From The Nonsense Factory</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5997942" target="_self">3:24 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

Don't work with those who denigrate your faith, your traditions, your morals, and your God. Don't tolerate or respect what passes for their morals and values.</blockquote>

		<a name="5998009"></a><div class="comments">I believe there actually was a similar brouhaha among British crime writers in the mid-90s. I'm not remembering the specifics, but there was some thing where PD James was on some middle-of-the-night BBC chat program and said that crime fiction had to be about middle-class-and-above people, because working-class people lacked the appropriate interior life to commit interesting crimes. Working-class crime was just people bashing other people over the head to take their money. The new guard of left crime writers howled, the old guard howled back about a lefty takeover of the genre, and there was much howling until everyone calmed down, realized that PD James was about 102 and a product of a different era, and continued writing whatever they wanted to write. I think that crime fiction people are pretty happy to coexist peacefully: I don't much want to read books about serial killers or cats solving murders in knitting shops, but I don't mind if that stuff exists. On the other hand, crime fiction readers are much, much less emotionally invested in their identity as crime fiction readers, I think, so it's probably not a very good comparison.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/190119" target="_self">ArbitraryAndCapricious</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998009" target="_self">4:46 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

Treated by whom? They still get their books published and movies made from them; their work still sells. I don't know about Wright but I know Card is still referenced as a writer in the genre that other writers should at least be familiar with, and serious readers also. Saying that I am uninterested in giving either of them my money or attention because of [whatever reason] is not exactly treating them like they have the plague.

That's because they are a plague. They are willing hosts for some really nasty diseases that have infected western culture in general and SF literature in particular.

		<a name="5998054"></a><div class="comments">It is fairly reasonable to believe that John C. Wright's presence on the "Puppy" Slates -- especially his VERY heavy representation on Vox Day's "Rabid Puppy" slate -- are because of his politics and not because of his writing.<br>
<br>
If he is there because of his politics, it is fair game to talk about his politics.  And his politics are odious.<br>
<br>
Almost everyone who has read John C. Wright on this thread who has commented on his work has in fact been fairly complimentary of his writing.<br>
<br>
But he did not get nominated because of his writing.  He did not get nominated on his merits.  He was, ironically, nominated in exactly the kind of political statement the people who nominated him claim they are against.  In fact, I feel confident stating my belief that the majority of nomination votes he got this year were from people who had not even read the works he is on the ballot for.<br>
<br>
When he gets nominated for his writing, then I'll comment on his writing.<br>
<br>
(As for Orson Scott Card, I don't want to bring that whole mess up again, but it's totally reasonable for me to think both that he is a terrible human being who wants to return to the days when I would be a criminal just for loving someone, and also that his ~4 Hugo awards were reasonably well-deserved.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998054" target="_self">5:48 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

<br>
I suppose it's not quite the OLDEST story in the world, but whether bad people can create good art is a question with a <a href="http://poetarium.info/pushkin/mozart_i_salieri.php">long and storied history</a>. (&lt;&lt;Он же гений, Как ты да я. А гений и злодейство — Две вещи несовместные. Не правда ль?&gt;&gt;)<br>
<br>
<br>
I fail to understand, however, what is so unique about OSC or JCW that I should consume their work (and pay them for it, presumably) despite finding their views appalling (and, hey, I've read Card, guess what, it does come out in his work, and it's icky, and I don't like it!). What, exactly, is WRONG with me not reading their books because I don't like their politics? Like, they are so vastly superior to all the other literature I can consume in my lifetime that I should put aside my dislike of their politics? Or the work is so profoundly important that I MUST read it?<br>
<br>
Most people aren't saying "They aren't good writers" but "I don't want to read their books." Why should I have to read their books? Why should I have to enjoy things that are gross to me? I sincerely doubt Orson Scott Card is running around saying, "Guys, you have GOT to go read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300107897/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="0300107897">Siken's Crush</a>, he turns the English language into a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/125773/When-I-say-this-it-should-mean-laughter-not-poison">heartrendingly beautiful account</a> of anxiety, fear, and obsession." If I'm obligated to recognize how "good" a work is regardless of its politics, and I ought not dislike a particular work because its author is a bad person, aren't the "puppy slate" people similarly obligated to force themselves to recognize the quality of the works by people like N.K. Jesimin and Jo Walton and others? By creating a slate of only authors they agree with politically, aren't they equally as deserving of your censure?<br>
<br>
But you're only complaining about how "lefty" SFF fans are being unfair -- I wonder why that is?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998066" target="_self">6:03 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

<i>I met Gene Wolfe at home in Peoria, where he returned in 2013 after many years in Barrington, Illinois. Although he had recently published a new novel, The Land Across, and was working on another, it was a melancholy visit. He had moved because his wife, suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, wanted to go home. But not long after their return, she entered an assisted-living facility, and she died on December 14. Wolfe had been ill himself, his eyesight and heart troubled, and for a time he had also been confined to a facility.

First of all, it feels awesome to be nominated for an award, and it would feel shitty to be all excited about being nominated and then realize that you were not, in fact, being recognized for your amazing writing, but were instead a pawn in some stupid game. Second of all, now she's in the middle of a shitstorm, and it's a shitstorm involving guys who get off on harassing and terrorizing women. If you stay in the competition, you're endorsing assholes, and if you don't stay in the competition, then you're making yourself a target of the gamergate mob. I would be crying in the bathroom too, honestly. <br>

But I'm not sure why this is the fault of the people who are not trying to game the Hugos and are not in league with the 'gaters.

Not because of his politics, but because I didn't think they were very good.  The first one was so-so, the second one was less than that, and the third, well I stopped halfway through.  So, not everyone agrees that he's a great writer.  Of course, not everyone agrees that my favorite authors are great either.  But I can say that so far as I know, neither Bill Gibson nor Martha Wells nor Ellen Kushner nor Iain Banks are (or in the case of the late lamented Mr. Banks, were) reactionary homophobic shits.  <br>

OK, that last bit was ad hominem, but justified.  Today's Easter, and I attended church this morning as I do every week, and I at least think that Messr.

Honestly, I don't even remember.  I go to the library.  I take out a book.  If I like it, or find it amusing, or even tolerable, I read another by the same author.  And so on.  But after a couple of books that I don't like by any one person, I bag it.  I recognize that probably shorts me on later better books by some people who've improved over their earlier works, but so be it.  And I can honestly say that my rule seems to apply to just about everyone, regardless of politics.  Jim Hines, who I agree with politically, just hasn't grabbed me enough to keep reading.  And Dave Freer, who seems to be part of the Sad Puppy crowd, is someone whose work I like and keep reading.  But Wright, meh. I don't find his stuff enjoyable or  interesting, and I don't like his politics.  So I don't bother.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/221603" target="_self">my dog is named clem</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998155" target="_self">8:25 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

		<a name="5998160"></a><div class="comments">Well, based on reading the comments in this thread, I can safely predict that the Rabid Puppies will sweep the Hugos this year, and every year hence, until and unless somebody can get the voting rules changed. Remember that the Streisand Effect works both ways, which is how Memories Pizza has gotten $840,000 in gofundme contributions in 4 days. The backlash against the Puppies cannot outvote the backlash to the backlash - especially after Vox Day's inevitable appearance on FoxNews. That'll open the floodgates for votes that'll let the Vox give acceptance speeches in both his categories, and Wright at least three. They might as well get Glenn Beck to host the awards show... he did write that Speculative Fiction Classic "The Overton Window". I did commit $40 of my meager 'entertainment' budget just to vote against writers and their writings I have no intent of ever reading,  which I do not in the least regret, since I know for every one of me there will be 2-3 on the other side who will be voting FOR things they have never read, just to deny some other books they'd prefer to have burned. <br>
<br>
BTW, I had never read any of Mr. Wright's works before today, so I went to Amazon to "look inside" a few of his books... I didn't have to get to any of his 'non'-fiction to realize I was totally wasting my time... if his works of the 2010s had been published in the 1970s, I'd think some of his crap was being directly parodied by Douglas Adams... and then, he'd at least have an excuse for being so creatively stale and moldy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998160" target="_self">8:39 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

So, assuming a ballot with one Kitten and four Puppies, if you didn't want Puppies to win at all, you'd vote:

<li>Kitten</li>

I'm no expert, but "<a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/changing-the-rules/">WSFS rules require that changes to the Constitution be passed twice, at two consecutive Worldcons</a>," and the Hugos are <a href="http://www.wsfs.org/bm/const-2014.html#article3">written into the WSFS constitution</a>.

This is where things get frankly delusional. I may not like what they did with their careers, but people like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have had a lasting and enormous impact on the fact of American media and politics, and through them, the world.  GamerGate has accomplished precisely nothing of lasting impact.  This has produced nothing of lasting impact thus far.  Except that this crowd has heard of Vox Day, and the conservative evangelical movement has largely not, and apparently he only considers a movement a success when he's prominent in it.  If anybody thought that Hugo awards were going to be the key to the hearts and minds of the Western world, Left Behind could have easily mustered enough people to get it a Hugo.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175568" target="_self">Sequence</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998201" target="_self">9:52 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

I read _Orphans_of_Chaos_ because it was free on the Kindle and I was stuck somewhere and needed something to read. I enjoyed it enough to pay for the other two books in the series. I thought they were reasonably well-written and definitely well-plotted -- and while they were somewhat derivative, his characterization was interesting enough to make it more than a retread of the somewhat tired "Jane Protagonist recovers her identity as an Important Person" trope. That said, I remember thinking that the ending was weak. And most of all, the way the female characters were written towards the end made me increasingly uncomfortable, to the point where I decided I didn't want to read anything else by the same author. Oddly, I can't say any more what specifically I didn't like (and I'm not interested in rereading to find out, either).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17035" target="_self">Slothrup</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998203" target="_self">9:58 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

<br>
Cry me a fucking river over poor Orson Scott Card and his "personal life". I was a huge fan of his work and got increasingly alienated and creeped out by the outright misogyny in so much of it, the shit where he stands on a pedestal and preaches from the mouth of his characters, and his managing to creepily conflate gayness with pedophilia every fucking time he creates a gay character. Maybe there are homophobic, misogynistic whackjobs who are able to create works that are separate from that, but Orson Scott Card has been inserting his shitty opinions into his work for decades and just happened to go enough off of the deep end to get people to actually start noticing what a goddamn shitbag he is in the past ~15 years. I really wish people would stop trying to apply the "but his BOOKS" argument shit when the only thing of his anyone's read is <em><em>Ender's Game</em></em>, because I read (the creepily conflating pedophilia and bisexuality) <em>Songbird</em>, (the weirdly menstruation-focused) <em>Wyrm</em>, and those Books of Mormon Rewritten As Sci-Fi books in which being gay is a ~choice~ and you can just ~imagine someone of the same sex while impregnating your BFF~ and everything will be okay.<br>
<br>
The amount of influence that Card (and the BYU creative writing department) has on sci-fi and fantasy makes me feel like shit on a regular basis because it's just another sign on the wall to say that this place isn't really <em>for</em> me. Card also puts a lot of other signs on the wall about other people who aren't welcome with the Islamaphobia and racism and shit. But the popularity of his fucking magazine and the fact that he keeps getting published in places like Lightspeed that I generally like-- it just makes me feel like there are a lot higher priorities that everyone has than diversity in SFF, and since the thing I want most from the genre right now is stories that I <em>actually find interesting</em> and one of the best ways to do that is to not be about the same boring heterosexual cisgender white people and actually, I dunno, <em>bother to fucking explore social dynamics</em> instead of just assuming that boring monogamous heterosexuality and love triangles and mean girls and gender roles were handed down to us by God at some point. If this is <em>speculative fucking fiction</em>, it wouldn't fucking kill anyone to actually speculate about sociolological constructs, and that's why I've been reading Ursula LeGuin, Rachel Hartman, NK Jemisin, Daniel Abraham/James SA Corey and Seanan McGuire/Mira Grant.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/84904" target="_self">NoraReed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998207" target="_self">10:07 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

Card served on the board of the National Organization for Marriage, who sponsored boycotts and was a major anti-gay advocacy group in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Wright, just this year, compared writers of same-sex relationships to termites and called for extermination.

<em>Castalia House was (per wikipedia) founded by Theodore Beale (aka Vox Day) in early 2014 in Kouvola, Finland. As their website explains:<br>
Castalia House is a Finland-based publisher that has a great appreciation for the golden age of science fiction and fantasy literature. The books that we publish honor the traditions and intellectual authenticity exemplified by writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Robert E. Howard, G.K. Chesterton, and Hermann Hesse. We are consciously providing an alternative to readers who increasingly feel alienated from the nihilistic, dogmatic science fiction and fantasy being published today. We seek nothing less than a Campbellian revolution in genre literature.</em><br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
<em>My guess: the Hugo awards are not remotely as diverse and interesting as the SFWAs Nebula Awards—an organization from which Vox Day became only the second person ever to be expelled. He clearly bears SFWA no love, and the qualification for SFWA membership (which confers Nebula voting rights) is to have professionally published three short stories or a novel. Castalia House is a publishing entity with a short story anthology series. Is the real game plan "Hugos today: Nebulas tomorrow?"</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/50756" target="_self">une_heure_pleine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998237" target="_self">10:58 PM</a>  on April 5, 2015

There was some really amusing bit where Colin was making some bad guy or other say that Amelia was the prettiest girl ever--"prettier than your girl" and finished up with "Good man! You get to live!" and chucking him overboard.<br>
<br>
Though yeah, the end was kind of a non-ending, and the creepy old guy/spanking shit was GACK. I haven't gotten rid of the books, but I don't particularly want to read anything else of them either. Oh yeah, and then I heard what the author is actually like. Sigh.<br>
<br>
This whole thing is disgusting, but in all honesty, I still can't say I'm interested in paying $40 to read fiction I wouldn't want to read/have the ability to vote against shitheads when I could spend that money on books I'd actually want to read instead. I admire y'all who do have those principles, I guess I'm just not that good of a person though. And I think it's kind of sad that a few works cited by the Evil League of Evil actually, y'know, might be good. I was pretty happy with the TV episode selections and while I don't think Skin Game was quite Hugo quality compared to the mind-blowing three books before it, that is not a bad book even if creeps approve because Jim Butcher is white and male. <br>
<br>
Either way, I think they won and trashed the award forever, though. Not sure how you'd come back from slate voting, which is something I've always hated in politics but especially comes off noxious here. At this point it's ruined the ability to vote for work you think is good if we're going to have the Rabid Puppies vs. the Non-Bigoted Kittens slate in 2016 just to fight back against it.

In the same way that I'd be more impressed with ID if it did its own science instead of being dependent on gainsaying the mainstream, I'd like to see the puppy farm build their own fandom based on strong writing and consistent effort in fiction. If they think that their morals and principles are incompatible with those of the Hugos, then of course they can run their own awards and they'd be free of any taint of intellectual cowardice and low-IQ cultural vandalism. After all, what do they want with baubles they clearly consider tainted already? Empires built on ravaging the neighbours are proven unsustainable by history.<br>

		<a name="5998534"></a><div class="comments"><em>So it seems a bit ridiculous to say that these writers can call for boycotts and discrimination of me, but we must read them anyway because free speech and all that.</em><br>
<br>
To clarify a little (from an actual computer) - I in no way think anyone is obligated to read any science fiction, for any reason under the sun. If you don't want to read it because you think the author is a jerk, or if you don't want to read it because numerologically speaking, the numbers in his names add up to something terrible, I really don't care. No one is obligated to read anything.<br>
<br>
However, they're pretty much correct that the Hugo has become political, that they were not the ones who made it that way, and that they are reacting to that. Mind you, <em>they are being assholes.</em> But while you are forced to read no science fiction, if you vote against people for Hugos based on their politics, you are making the Hugos political. Even if you are doing so in a backlash. Every time you make a vote for the Hugos based on anything besides the specific works, comparatively to other works, you are making the Hugos political. That is why they give you all the works free - so that you can read and vote in a fair environment. When you vote for the Hugos, the expectation has been that you will be voting for works of quality <em>in a vacuum,</em> so that SF fans the world over will be able to, in a vacuum, know which works are pretty damn good to read.<br>
<br>
And yes, that means that if you are voting for someone purely because you want a more diverse Hugo-winning slate, you are being political at the Hugos. And this ship has sailed at least five to ten years ago, back when authors started making slates of their own and their friends/right-thinking-peers on Livejournal and asking everyone to vote for everything they were eligible for and also what those friends were eligible for.<br>
<br>
Now again, I am in no way suggesting that Vox Day's slate is apolitical. There are some damn good reads there, but there's also Tom Kratman, who is the NK Jemisin of the right. If what you have hungered for all your life to read is someone<em> finally</em> writing a Mary Sue special forces character that excels at sticking it to those damn peaceniks who don't realize they are bringing about an Islamic Empire where Christian women will be slaves in the streets, only to read diaries of their peacenik ancestors and weep at their blind ignorance...well then you have Tom Kratman, and maybe he is good if you have been hungering for those things all your life <small>(but really it sucks)</small>. Similarly, if what you have hungered for all your life is to read someone finally writing a Mary Sue POC character that is unconventionally attractive and anti-feminine yet so special even gods fall in love with her and have magical bed-breaking sex who fights racism and is a Liberator and things that are supposed to kill her can't because she's so damn <em>special</em>, with incoherent plot and purple metaphor..then go ahead and read NK Jemisin and her Hundred Thousand Kingdoms. <small>(But seriously, don't.)</small><br>
<br>
In each case, these writings are not in any way Hugo-worthy, but they are nominated by people who want to celebrate the people they like and stick it to people they don't like. And this makes for worse Hugos. It makes for worse Hugos when you have people putting up diversity slates and it makes for worse Hugos when people put together anti-diversity slates. It makes for worse Hugos when people are trying to use the Hugos to Say! Important! Things! And it really, really makes for worse Hugos when people are voting against<em> even authors they admit are good</em> just because they don't like that they were included in the Sad Puppies slate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998534" target="_self">10:40 AM</a>  on April 6, 2015

		<a name="5998548"></a><div class="comments"><em> they're pretty much correct that the Hugo has become political, that they were not the ones who made it that way, and that they are reacting to that</em><br>
<br>
When do you think it became political? Because I think that they were always political. In the past 5 or so years there was a push to notice that, actually, people who weren't white guys or Lois McMaster Bujold wrote good speculative fiction and maybe they should be read too. But I don't think that, as a whole, crappy books were voted for just because they were written by the right people. <br>
<br>
I don't particularly object to the once a year "here's what I wrote" posts; they're useful, especially for categories that aren't best novel. I know a lot of people do object to them. But they weren't particularly political, and mostly authors stuck to their own work, with sometimes a roundup of lists other people gave. Reviewers more often gave their own specific slates, but usually with a few runners up. I mean, I see that it's a problem because popular authors have bigger reach, but they're also often better writers with more fans -- that's why they're popular. <br>
<br>
<em>Every time you make a vote for the Hugos based on anything besides the specific works, comparatively to other works, you are making the Hugos political.</em> <br>
<br>
Sure, "I won't vote for any slate" is political, but it's more about the politics of following custom than anything else (most people have noted that there are things they would have voted for had they not been on the slate). And nominating a strict slate is in any case significantly more political.<br>
<br>
<em>And yes, that means that if you are voting for someone purely because you want a more diverse Hugo-winning slate, you are being political at the Hugos.</em> <br>
<br>
But I don't see any real evidence that this has been done.<br>
<br>
<em> It makes for worse Hugos when you have people putting up diversity slates and it makes for worse Hugos when people put together anti-diversity slates.</em> <br>
<br>
People haven't put up diversity slates.<br>
<br>
<em> And it really, really makes for worse Hugos when people are voting against even authors they admit are good just because they don't like that they were included in the Sad Puppies slate.</em><br>
<br>
It makes for worse ones this year (maybe -- people seem to agree that Butcher is good [I dropped his series 6 or 8 books in] but probably not Hugo-worthy for any one book), but the Hugos are a long-running thing, and if this means that slates in general will fail, it probably will make for a better Hugo.<br>
<br>
(Now, this can easily turn into Sarcastic Puppies, where VD decides to put up a slate of "SJW SF" to prove that people won't vote against slates that are on their political side; I don't know what might happen then.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998548" target="_self">11:00 AM</a>  on April 6, 2015

		<a name="5998549"></a><div class="comments">So just to illustrate kind of some chains of how these things can happen - here are <a href="http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2013/04/articles/my-thoughts-on-the-2013-hugo-nominations/">some people talking</a> about the <a href="http://www.staffersbookreview.com/2013/04/can-we-stop-talking-about-the-hugos-now.html">inexplicable popularity</a> and<em> prolific aggressive nominating-pimping</em> of Seanan McGuire at the Hugos. <blockquote>... it’s also important to continue to examine ourselves and ensure that we don’t fall prey to the same insular behaviour that has caused the issues that we’re fighting against in the first place. As suggested by Landon’s research, block voting is very much alive and well in the newer Hugo voters, and writers like Mark Oshiro, and bloggers like Elitist Book Reviews likely have Seanan McQuire and Larry Correira as much to thank for their nominations as they do their persistence, talent and body of work, which might be Hugo-worthy in-and-of-itself. It’s always who you know, isn’t it?</blockquote>

And Seanan McGuire is not only an aggressive nominator, she's also friends and coworkers with other aggressive nominators, and she's pretty prolific all over LJ - which as is noted, is a pretty incestuous SF/fantasy town very committed to dethroning the old and emplacing the new. If you're going to talk about dethroning bloc voting, then we also need to stop having these authors publicly pimping for themselves and their friends, which even Mefi's own Scalzi <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/04/20/no-the-hugo-nominations-were-not-rigged/">admits has been happening for a long time</a>. <blockquote>it’s also not entirely honest to say that it’s not been done before, either. Lots of people suggest or at least remind people of their own works for consideration (I do the latter); lots of people suggest or at least remind people of the works of others for consideration. Just this year I suggested Abagail Nussbaum for Fan Writer; there she is on the ballot. Was my recommendation causative? Maybe, maybe not (I suspect not — she’s built a reputation over a number of years), but the point is I made the recommendation.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998549" target="_self">11:01 AM</a>  on April 6, 2015

Make no mistake - importing GamerGate folk is fucking vile and I am not arguing otherwise. But the thing is - most people don't actually vote for the Hugos. Hell, I'm aware and interested and don't always bother to get a membership to vote for the Hugos. I would actually wager that most casual fans were not even really aware of the Hugos until authors and people who move in those worlds started making posts about them on the internet and encouraging people to get supporting memberships and vote for the things they liked.

First, I am getting a membership this year, when I have not before, specifically because I AM a science fiction fan.  I suspect that will be true for a lot of people.<br>
<br>
Second, as others have pointed out, authors promoting their own works and recommending a few others, mostly to extant fans, is entirely different from promoting a massive slate based entirely on political views and gaming the system by explicitly seeking out and encouraging political sympathizers to vote.<br>
<br>
Third, I wouldn't vote for a "Social Justice" slate either, and neither would most people who are upset by this, because part of the point is that a political slate demeans and sullies what is supposed to be a merit-based writing award.<br>
<br>
Fourth, you haven't really presented evidence for the existence of a "Social Justice" slate coming first, either, except that a book you particularly dislike was nominated four years ago.  And didn't win.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998630" target="_self">12:11 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

<br>
Now, you're just dragging the goalposts around the field from "who are being treated like they have the plague because in their personal life, they don't like gay people" which is what I responded to, and changing the subject back to the Hugos. I'll point out there that Card hasn't received a best novel nomination since 1992. <br>
<br>
Now personally, I don't vote for the Hugos. If I were to vote, it would probably reflect my bias for works similar to Le Guin, Vonnegut, Dick, Butler, Wolfe, and Delany.  Not because I entirely agree with their politics, but because they deliver brilliant writing that stretches the genre, books I find myself re-reading and writing about months or years after my first encounter with them.<br>
<br>
I don't know what you're on about since Jemisin was only nominated once and didn't win. I don't think Kingdoms is much more of a Mary Sue story than Cyroburn on the same ballot (I love Miles to death but he's a total Gary Stu.)

		<a name="5998669"></a><div class="comments">The problem with bloc voting, regardless of who is doing it, is that it seems to lead to an end-state where books end up getting awards that would not have necessarily won awards simply on their own merits, and in the long run that hurts the value of the award.  It means that someone looking at a book with "Hugo Award Winner" on the cover, a few decades down the road, is going to have to consider what exactly the hell was going on with the Hugos that year.  Not the end of the world or anything, but unfortunate.  <br>
<br>
Granted, I am actually not so sure that awards like the Hugos are really as important today as they were, oh, 20 or 30 years ago; Amazon has a <em>creepily</em> good idea of what I'm going to enjoy and will happily feed me recommendations until my Kindle screen finally succeeds in melting my eyeballs with its fluorescent glow or I run out of money, whichever comes first.  And I think that's increasingly how people are finding books (not necessarily just via Amazon, although I think the Bezos Machine is pretty significant, but also via Goodreads and other similar recommendation engines).<br>
<br>
As a sidebar, that does underscore the crazypants nature of the Sad Puppies slate/bloc/brigade/whatever.  There has probably <i>never been a better time</i> to be writing B-grade lowbrow literature aimed at a niche audience.  Seriously; not even in the golden age of pulp could you reach as broad a base of readers as you can today, at such a low cost, and with so little impulse-buy friction.  You don't even have to thread the needle of making a cover lurid enough to attract readers while also not stepping wholly over the bounds of what a respectable person can read on the bus.  We're in a new golden age of <i>porn</i> today.  And porn doesn't just have to mean sex: porn can be, well, whatever does it for you.  And a lot of the Sad Puppies authors are really writing porn—and I don't mean that in a bad way, per se, I'm all for porn—albeit porn that I find somewhat personally appalling, including as it does a lot of unnecessary violence and misogyny.  (But I find a lot of people's porn appalling, and I'm sure the feeling is mutual, so that's neither here nor there.) <br>
<br>
Which brings us back to the Sad Puppies and the Hugos.  It seems apparent that as both readers and writers (at least for the writers who have actually thrown in with the "movement", such as it is), they don't want to <em>admit</em> that they're basically writing porn aimed at emasculated middle-class white dudes who want to Mary Sue themselves into the conquering badass hero who gets all the girls, for a few hours.  Despite the fact that you can make a hell of a living doing that, and you can read whatever you want on the bus with nobody but God and your e-reader being the wiser, <i>it's not good enough</i>.<br>
<br>
No, for whatever reason they need to not only write those sort of books—which is fine, in itself; consenting adults, freedom of the press and all that—but they need to legitimize it as, if not capital-L Literature (lol Vox Day thinks they're following in the tradition of <em>Hermann Hesse?!</em>), at least as Science Fiction in the grand tradition of the authors they read as teenagers or something.  And co-opting the Hugos is apparently how they've decided to do it.  And that sucks.<br>
<br>
If the Sad Puppies crowd was correct in saying that the Hugos were being used as some sort of affirmative action program for minority-viewpoint novels that weren't also good works taken independently of that, then IMO that would also suck, but frankly I've never really seen much evidence of that.  It seems awfully close to the Gamergate plank of how somehow PC games are being 'ruined' somehow, which I've also never seen any evidence of.  So I'm pretty skeptical, to put it lightly.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36800" target="_self">Kadin2048</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998669" target="_self">12:46 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

<br>
The trouble with Amazon and so on is that they follow the old Civil Service rule that 'nothing shalt be done for the first time': it will not recommend something that's nobody's read yet. Fandom plays the essential role of the early adopter, the experimentally-minded seekers after the new who love their field so much they're prepared to risk time and money exploring in areas where they expect to come up dry more times than not. I've worked on awards in IT before now, and the idea there was not to reward success, it was to reward invention. They were proudly and obviously pump-priming (and I spent months of my life sieving though dross...). <br>
<br>
If the Hugos (or whatever) are to be relevant into the future where the Bezotron Knows All, Sees All (Except The New), this really has to be the major part of their existence. How much it has bben or is now, is a matter for pleasurable and endless discussion, but there's no way that Operation Puppy is anything other than poisonously antithetical to that. One could even argue that in seeking out new life and new innovations, the Hugos are indeed politically opposed to conservatism and in that, the immature dog squad are exactly correct - but that this is precisely what the Hugos have to be if they're to do their job, and if VD et al want to go and celebrate pre-Enlightenment values they should do that for themselves.  <br>
<br>
But there's no role for logic here. This is a publicity stunt by impotent narcissists with rocket envy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/44972" target="_self">Devonian</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998703" target="_self">1:12 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

		<a name="5998724"></a><div class="comments"><em>I would actually wager that most casual fans were not even really aware of the Hugos until authors and people who move in those worlds started making posts about them on the internet and encouraging people to get supporting memberships and vote for the things <strong>they</strong> liked.</em> (emphasis added)<br>
<br>
So the last <em>they</em> in that phrase is ambiguous. I suspect you meant it to refer to the people posting recommendation lists — that the movers and shakers were bringing in new recruits to vote for the specific works that the movers and shakers recommended. But the other reading of the sentence is the one that reflects my experiences: That the movers and shakers encouraged people to start voting for works that <em>the people</em> liked. <br>
<br>
As someone who's still relatively new to voting and nominating in the Hugos, for a long time I felt like I wasn't good enough, wasn't knowledgeable enough, to participate in the rarified awards. Then I started participating, thanks to encouragement from bloggers (particularly Scalzi and Nussbaum). And I never once got the impression that I was being told who to vote for. Instead, the message I got was that I really was "fan enough" to participate in the Hugos, and that my tastes and opinions were valid enough that I should make them known.<br>
<br>
Before Sad/Rabid Puppy, I never saw a suggestion that I should vote for a work that I hadn't read, or that I didn't legitimately enjoy. But I find it incredibly difficult to believe that the voters for the puppy slates really did read everything they nominated.<br>
<br>
For example, Letters from Gardner is nominated for Best Related Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/coalescent/17038229312/">Niall Harrison's statistics</a>, we know that, at a minimum, 206 people nominated that book. Yet there are 0 reviews of it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0692299424/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="0692299424">Amazon.com</a>. None. Nor are there reviews on Amazons <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Letters-Gardner-Writers-Lou-Antonelli/dp/0692299424/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428339863&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Letters+from+Gardner">.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Letters-Gardner-Writers-Lou-Antonelli/dp/0692299424/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428338000&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Letters+from+Gardner">.in</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Letters-Gardner-Writers-Lou-Antonelli/dp/0692299424/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428339977&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=letters+from+gardner">.co.uk</a><sup>*</sup>. So which of these scenarios should I believe?
<ol>
<li>That Letters from Gardner is a Hugo-worthy book that was of high enough quality to be recommended by both Torgersen and Day (it's both a Sad and Rabid Puppy). And, thanks to those men's influence, over 200 people read the book and also felt it Hugo-worthy. Yet throughout most of the English-speaking world, nobody bothered to voice their praise for it on the world's dominant bookseller.</li>
<li>That a bunch of people nominated the book without reading it, because they were told to.</li>
</ol>

Unfortunately, I find scenario 2 more plausible. And that's a key difference between the puppy slates and the recommendations of prior years.<br>
<br>
<small><sup>*</sup>The book is not listed on Amazon in Australia or China. I didn't check countries beyond those.</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998724" target="_self">1:23 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

<br>
As has been said here, nobody needs to read any single thing they don't want to, and I actually don't read Sanderson myself, because epic fantasy just isn't usually my jam. I mostly know him form the Writing Excuses podcast, which I love, and I which I think has had a good effect on his worldview, with Kowal, Wells and Taylor pulling his leftward pretty consistently. My point being, I guess, that while he definitely still has room for the bigot-spiral, and his past statements haven't always been good, his progression on these issues has been pretty purely towards the side of good, inclusion, rights, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyway, maybe you're right and it's just the difference between the sink and the sink+bathtub. I'm not in a great position to say. It just seems like such an improvement over a double-down bigot like Card that maybe my perception is warped.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/38322" target="_self">Navelgazer</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998760" target="_self">2:03 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

Maybe I'm not a trufan in some people's eyes because I didn't bother until now. But the goobergaters are trying to storm the castle and it's time for coattail riders like me to woman the barricades. I think of this as giving back to a community whose works I've enjoyed for the last 30+ years.<br>

<blockquote>Have the sad puppies really done anything that hordes of authors don’t do as a matter of routine, albeit on a smaller scale? Are we talking a change of kind, or merely of degree?</blockquote>

Yes.<br>
<br>
It's hard for me to believe that Watts doesn't understand the difference between campaigning for the inclusion of a single work (which, while far from ideal, still leaves space for other works to emerge and also results in that work competing with other works for the actual award) and campaigning for a slate that encompasses the entire category, thus preventing any other works from being included and ensuring that one of them will win the award.  Or, of course, No Award will win, as I very much hope is the case.<br>
<br>
I don't know, this is probably overly cynical of me, but maybe the silver lining of this whole debacle is that I'm learning whose opinion in various Internet realms I can safely discount as being either a) uninformed, b) someone who's swallowed the puppy delusions about terrible leftists being mean to conservatives because they have <strike>controversial views</strike> literally endorsed violence against people like me and/or fought to restrict our rights or c) doesn't understand the dynamics of privilege and oppression.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73881" target="_self">overglow</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998780" target="_self">2:20 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

I was merely pointing out that battles for the soul of fandom go all the way back. Sometimes, it's just clash of egos. Sometimes - as in both 1939 and right now - there's a pretty clear right and wrong.</i><br>
<br>
I wasn't responding to your framing, it was indeed a "huge to do". Though, it's fair to point out that Pohl, in later years, downplayed the whole thing and chalked it up to him and the other Futurians getting on the nerves of the Worldcon organizers. On the one hand, the Futurians weren't always the best-behaved (Wollheim, for instance, would denounce the Triumvirs as "fakefans") but the Triumvirs didn't exactly take it all in their stride. Of course, all these things have receded into history now, but the Triumvirs lost what little Fannish support they'd had after the Great Exclusion Act after they physically manhandled a bunch of Futurians at some minor convention.<br>
<br>
<small>Note: I realize that writing anything about the history of science fiction fandom is impossible without sounding like some kind of Borges parody. </small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998814" target="_self">2:48 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

Never mind that this fear has never borne fruit, but the assertion that this is about conservatives or libertarians is completely unsupported, and it would be nice if you stopped coming up with a baseless accusations that the backlash against the Sad/Rabid Puppies is about that. Now, if conservative/libertarian SFF thinks that the most valued voices on their side are the most virulently nasty, that's their choice. If they want to be associated with thugs and hate speech and violence, that's their choice. If they freak out at the mere suggestion of something that doesn't adhere to their decades-old idea of SFF (as Correia and friends do on regular basis) and think that a genre based on looking forward should never do so, that's their choice. The only people that bear responsibility for horrifying, divisive, abusive shit-spewing being associated with conservatives and libertarians in SFF are the people that decided to engage in said shit-spewing.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998860" target="_self">3:16 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

That's just putting the cart in front of the horse, now. Again, the issue isn't that conservative SFF itself is the problem, it's that (a) they decided <em>en masse</em> to make it all about "SJWs" rather than the other way around, and (b) they embrace the fact that the Venn diagram between them and people that support horrible things is pretty close to a circle (which is rich, coming from the kind of people that will regularly accuse anyone to the left of Ted Cruz of "palling around with terrorists"). The combination of the two is, as <strong>rtha</strong> points out, responding to a slate of "what we like is diverse" with "diversity is stupid and therefore I will campaign against it." And again, the fact that they decided to choose the worst people in the world to further their misguided reactionary bullshit is their problem.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998895" target="_self">3:37 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

I kind of was because it was difficult to be in LJ and not notice it. But it had nothing to do with the Puppies, MilSF or conservative SF, and moreover, people like the Nielsen Haydens were receiving the heavy criticisms from the social justice front.<br>

The closest this has to do with this year's Hugos is the nomination of the Mixon Report, which hasn't been possible because of the Puppies, certainly.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/181391" target="_self">sukeban</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998926" target="_self">3:54 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

<br>
Nor was RaceFail a calculated attempt to devalue one of the industry's most prestigious awards.<br>
<br>
Above it was mentioned that the Hugo is just an award and not that important in the grand scheme of things. I disagree. When readers want to dip their toes into the sci-fi genre for the first time, what books do they turn to? How do they figure out where to start? If you haven't browsed sci-fi books on Amazon before, it's not going to begin recommending any. New readers are going to find books by browsing bookstore end-caps and reading awards lists.<br>
<br>
Genre authors often have trouble getting their work considered as "literary" by the establishment. Does it help if we don't even have a set of books with a minimum standard of quality to point to? If the big name awards are filled with rubbish? And not like "ugh that doesn't deserve an Oscar" level of rubbish. You might not agree with a specific Oscar winner, but it will at least be watchable. Some of the works nominated for the Hugo this year are barely readable. Is that what authors like Hoyt want to have put forward as the best their genre can accomplish? <br>
<br>
Devaluing the Hugo by making it something anyone can buy hurts all sci-fi authors, no matter their politics.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/187892" target="_self">tofu_crouton</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998958" target="_self">4:25 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

Likely the losers in this exchange are VanderMeer and Liu, both of whom made the Nebula list with 33,000 and 8,000 copies. Not that sales should determine who gets on the list, but the Puppies seem to be making two contradictory claims regarding the SF&amp;F market.

<br>
Indeed. Also, RaceFail wasn't about progressives vs. reactionaries (or Democrats vs Republicans, to put it into baldly American political terms). It was about Outsiders &amp; Insiders; transformative fandom vs. affirmative fandom; people who were primarily fans/readers, including people of color, pushing back against established writers &amp; publishers for condoning a variety of sins, including cultural appropriation, racist stereotyping, and flat ignorance regarding the cultures portrayed in their work and evidenced in their readership.<br>
<br>
And the folks who took the most heat in RaceFail were Elizabeth Bear and the Nielsen Haydens, both of whom are considered by VD and his like to be on the side of the demons now.  (Scalzi stepped into the crap once or twice but managed to recover his footing; Bear &amp; the NHs have just gone on without ever confronting their own behavior. It doesn't seem to have hurt any of their careers.)<br>
<br>
All that said, what RaceFail and MammothFail did was put it on notice that SF/F includes not just the old white guys, but also thousands and thousands of women and people of color (and women of color) and international fans (including, btw, Abigail Nussbaum), and they (we) are tired of all the stories being about manly het white American men.  And tired of so many of the awards going to white het American men.  (Yes, Bujold &amp; Willis won a lot, and so did Samuel Delany. But the numbers are still fairly damning.)<br>
<br>
[An anecdote: when Lois McMaster Bujold made an ill-considered comment in public about how she didn't realize she had many readers of color, because she never saw them at cons -- in response, 35,000 fans of color posted to one LJ entry, in order to show that they existed and were fans of SF/F. That's just folks who had LJ accounts, back in 2005 or so, and who heard about the call to raise their hands and be counted. I imagine that if you were a racist shit like VD, comfortable in your white enclave of SF/F, that showing might be unsettling.]<br>
<br>
Anyway, the uproars were apparently enough to scare VD and his ilk, because they can feel the demographic hill eroding beneath them, and what will they be if they're not able to say they're better/more important than all those Other (brown) people?<br>
<br>
I don't have the historical chops to make this compelling, but I'm seeing a real strong association with the Jim Crow laws here -- Those People must be kept in their place, or we'll lose ours.  And it's all done with appeals to historical &amp; biblical authority; not to the Bible here, but to the sainted John Campbell &amp; Heinlein, Lovecraft and Howard.  <br>
<br>
It's all pretty gross and traumatic.  But -- pardon the analogy -- blaming this on calls for diversity and equality of race, sex, orientation, and gender presentation is like blaming the violence at the Edward Pettus Bridge on the black marchers.  The correct response to calls for equality isn't blowing up the place, no matter how rude you think the equality-seekers might be.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998972" target="_self">4:35 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

I suspect that the reason why Jemisin keeps getting namedropped in this discussion in spite of going 0-1 on the Hugos is because she's a prolific blogger and critic of Beale and Wright.

Excerpt: <blockquote>What the Hugo awards are vulnerable to isn’t the bitter argument between liberals and conservatives, but the clever manipulation of such differences by self-promoters. Most writers, even in relatively commercially genres like sci-fi and fantasy, sell remarkably low numbers of books. It’s not surprising, then, that some writers ramp up political arguments as a way of gaining the attention they crave, and pulling publicity stunts like block-voting campaigns. Some involved with the block vote no doubt believe they are on a righteous crusade against liberals in sci-fi. But that only makes them more easily exploited by those who are only interested in gaining status and selling books. </blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999009" target="_self">5:16 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

<br>
The Hugos are broken, because those of a particular ideological bent can purchase and control the nomination process and stack the deck against authors whose views on politics and gender they consider dubious.<br>
<br>
What's amusing is that it doesn't really matter how you interpret that.  Is that the mainstream's complaint about the Puppies or the Puppies' complaint about the mainstream?  Doesn't matter in and of itself because the mere fact that it's possible -- and demonstrably possible in that it is the Puppies' STRATEGY as well as their complaint -- deep-sixes the award's credibility until it is fixed.<br>

Well. I mean. That's hardly a bar to clear. It's like being less deep than the Mariana Trench. But yes, she's not at all a bad writer -- I wasn't engaged by the book, but I wasn't actively put off and would possibly pick up another if I heard the right buzz around it -- and I am not suggesting that she didn't deserve her nomination or that had she won it would would have been a miscarriage of justice. (Actually, though I enjoyed the Willis, I don't think it deserved the win that year.)<br>
<br>
Jemisin is hardly the point, though -- she's just an example (along with Swirsky, often, and of course Scalzi) -- of authors who people seem to claim got their nominations through Nefarious Means rather than people just liking their work.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999018" target="_self">5:22 PM</a>  on April 6, 2015

I only kinda liked <i>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</i> (I tend to bounce off stories where the magical element is all bound up in sex -- my New England upbringing coming to the fore again, no doubt), but I really enjoyed <i>The Killing Moon</i> and <i>The Shadowed Sun</i>, which are creative and plotty, with less to-do about sexually-attractive gods and more about on-the-ground politics and empire (and magic). <br>

I'm looking forward to her next novel, <i>The Fifth Season</i>.<br>

He can appease a mob, lead a rebellion, give orders, follow orders, seduce a countess, fight with a longsword, build a campfire, repair a car engine, write a constitution,<strong> comfort the grieving (usually with a brisk slap in the face and a curt command to snap out of it)</strong>, receive confession, sway a jury, suture a wound, and escape from a sinking submarine with a knife clutched in his teeth."<br>

I think it's interesting that Wright believes that Korra's creators "sold [their] integrity out to the liberal establishment." In other words, that their choice for the characters was a subversion of the artists' true desires in favor of the marketplace and pablum.

This in a nation where the Pauls have been generating tons of press and loving attention from dullards all across the country?  I live in a liberal-ish college town in the middle of a rural county, and about once a month there's at least one if not more nimrods standing on a street corner protesting the secretive and evil Federal Reserve, which, apparently is the lovechild of Lenin and Satan (on second thought, maybe not, since that's a little too man-on-man).  I always have to fight off the desire to point out to them that Alan Greenspan was one of Ayn Rand's biggest groupies.<br>
<br>
Anyway, have you ever read any of Hoyt's stuff? The word 'turgid' springs to mind.  As does the phrase 'all-too-put-downable.'  Yikes.  She's even worse than Wright.  I have yet to finish a book by her that I've picked up.<br>
<br>
But like Wright she seems convinced that there's some Sekret Conspiracy out to punish provocative right-leaning authors, and to deny them vital access to the public's imagination.  Except of course that they're both published by not-small presses.  One might almost think that people are ignoring them because their work ISN'T VERY GOOD.

I didn't read all the way through because my eyes glazed over in pure self-defense (blood pressure zooming up can't be good for eyeballs), so I don't know if he makes the direct comparison anywhere in the middle or is satisfied with the allusion in the start. But from the glimpses I unavoidably caught while skimming and from the end of the piece in particular, I'm inclined to think that he didn't make the direct comparison. Hitler is small fries, after all, when the insuniation he <em>really</em> wants to make is something along the lines of a smiling, two-faced accomplice of the literal Christian-defined Satan. <br>
<br>
About a man who was one of the truly most full-of-grace-and-mercy human beings I've ever crossed paths with.  Because he wanted to die with dignity and believed others should have the right also.<br>

I...excuse me while I go devolve into choking sputters.<br>

(Welp, at least I know for sure I don't even need to attempt the Wright bits of the ballot now either? Silver linings? And no, really, don't say anything about judging works by merits in this case, I don't think I could see any merit in anything he writes any more unless five people whose tastes I trust absolutely swear that Wright has written, somehow, something as gracious as <em>Hogfather</em>.

The second is that I'm largely into speculative fiction because I'm interested in worldbuilding, and people who are so blinded by their privilege that they utterly fail to understand a lot of relevant social issues seem unlikely to be good at that. I mean, they're failing at getting the worldbuilding of reality, right? Why would I want to read the worldbuilding they make up? And when I look back at stuff I read when I was younger and look at the serious failings, they often come from ignoring social justice issues. Unrealistically behaving women, Planet Of People From [Country], invisible servants who never seem to effect the plot in any way and have no characterization, stuff like that-- it's bad writing, bad worldbuilding, and I find that shit really distracting. I'm no longer willing to suspend my disbelief about stuff like "there are people who are not white" and "queer people are okay", let alone stretch it around really out-of-control Islamaphobia, slavery apologia, etc. And you're pretty much always gonna get shit like that from reading people who are fundamentally wrong about how the world works, and bigots are, indeed, fundamentally wrong. And assholes. But it's the "wrong" part that makes me feel like I'm really not missing anything by avoiding their works.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/84904" target="_self">NoraReed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999397" target="_self">12:12 AM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="5999533"></a><div class="comments">What counts as campaigning? I mean, clearly telling your mother you're up for an award doesn't count. Sending e-mails to your friends probably doesn't count either. I suppose the question is whether telling your twitter followers you're up for an award counts as campaigning. The form of the award clearly matters. A juried award doesn't present this problem, but an open vote award like the Hugos does. And god knows that the Hugo voters have opted for some questionable choices throughout its history, some of which I'm sure is explainable through the personal popularity of the authors. I'm generally okay with that, it's the nature of the Hugo Awards. But yes, at a certain point, once you're being too insistent in getting people to vote for you, it slips into campaigning and becomes distasteful. On the other hand, if you're mid-level author, you're going to have a hard time beating someone who's universally beloved.<br>
<br>
But I'm not entirely sure what the Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies have done counts as campaigning. I mean, they're not persuading people to give their works a chance, they're asking people to vote for a bunch of nominations, sight unseen. For instance, there's almost no way that most of the people who voted on a slate basis could tell you how the nominees in the short-form and long-form editing categories compare to other editors out there. That's not persuasion, which seems to me to be a fundamental feature of campaigning. This is something else, and something worse.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999533" target="_self">7:56 AM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="5999564"></a><div class="comments">Indeed, kattullus, and I think your comment calls out how sad puppies and hugoes both suffer from multiple problems. In this respect I agree with Justinian and fffm at the same time. There are problems with the puppies that are bigger than them, that are and have been part of the hugoes for some time, and also that the puppies represent either a deeper low in these areas, or an entirely new one altogether. <br>
<br>
I think discussing all the myriad problems is useful, because it shapes what the better solutions might look like.  <br>
<br>
Personally speaking I haven't accorded the hugoes any respect for years. I feel they are both grossly unrepresentative, accorded far, far more weight than their tiny voting pools, riven with personal relationships etc merit,  and routinely skate over worthy contributions. <br>
<br>
I can see three ways of dealing with it a soupcon of success:<br>
1. Move to a jury. Bias for sure but at least bias with a modicum of taste and understanding of the field. <br>
2.expand the voting pool such that the mewling minority approach a representative weight, whatever that may be. (and let's not be so confident that shit won't float: the biggest selling sf/f is by no means the best. Such are popularity contests) <br>
3. Either kill the hugoes, or place that respect elsewhere. Give them the status that they deserve as both a popularity contest, and a popularity contest amongst a very very small group of readers that wouldn't add up to a hundredth of those reading the books. <br>
<br>
If it isn't obvious, I would personally go for three :I think they're crap; they've been crap for years and years.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/91529" target="_self">smoke</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999564" target="_self">8:57 AM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="5999573"></a><div class="comments">The Hugos have always been fairly unrepresentative, but this is a problem with awards of this kind in general.  They are in many ways a byproduct of the largely unquestioned consensus of the 20th century that a given work is "best" having been approved by a selection of tastemakers.  Lists like this often identify five good works only to bury ten more.  Given how easy it is to find and pick up fiction these days, even older and less well-known authors, I think awards have to find a way to be more specific or interestingly constructed to be relevent.  (I think both the Tiptree and the World Fantasy awards have more utility these days, for example).<br>
<br>
Also, given some of the patterns of nomination over the past decade or more for this particular award, I don't think it's really possible to argue that there isn't a sort of clique(s) involved, although I suspect it's not a deliberate one.  Add to this that some of the people who seem to most invested in the proceedings (TNH, for example) seem to be really hostile to people with different perspectives, and it's not totally surprising that it's become a focus of unpleasantness.  I don't think it really deserves Vox Day, but it's hard to say who would deserve him.  <small>Piers Morgan?</small><br>
<br>
The very strange thing about the SP brouhaha is that these people actually seem to care so much about this particular award in the first place.  What's stopping them from merely reading the plentiful and easily obtained fiction that appears to be their taste?  To paraphrase Vonnegut, they are like "a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae or a banana split.”<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17648" target="_self">selfnoise</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999573" target="_self">9:19 AM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
See, this is the kind of stuff that makes it pretty obvious that a lot of the people objecting to the Puppies aren't really sticking firm to ideals, but are just, themselves, voting along party lines. You think the Puppies aren't slating for artistic merit, so...you're going to say 'fuck you' to artistic merit in order to show them? How does that even make sense?<br>
<br>
And <strong>justinian</strong> is entirely right about this. The Sad Puppies slate isn't just made up of people marching in lockstep, or you <em>wouldn't have people being nominated while having no idea who don't even share the political views.</em> The Sad Puppies slate seems a combination of merit and 'in your eye, SJW!' - less, 'ha ha, we are going to deliberately nominate people who suck' and more 'We're going to nominate people who we think are good but who are being unfairly deprived of nominations through the workings of the SJW machine." Which, functionally, no, I don't think is very different at all from 'Here are the things I and my friends are eligible for' <em>or</em> 'Here are the things I'm eligible for and the things I think are good." <br>
<br>
Sadly the computer ate a long post I was writing about how precisely RaceFail ties into this, but in short, SJW people were suggesting a lot of noms after RaceFail that were based more on ideology than on good writing - which is why NK Jemisin comes up in these types of conversations, as she was one of the loud voices on LJ in that, only to be nominated a year later for her debut novel which, even if her other work has gotten better since then, is nowhere near Hugo quality. Seanan McGuire is another whose work is not particularly high in quality, but who is Loud On Twitter About Things and thus is flagging as One Of The Good Guys. And I think that after RaceFail, a lot more people in the SJW part of the SF community were interested in throwing their votes to people they perceived as the Good Guys - which definitely horrified people who were suggesting that authors should be judged on merit and not on their SJW credentials.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999621" target="_self">10:11 AM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
The thing is, 'excluding all other contenders' looks a lot like 'making sure everyone possible gets a seat' through a glass darkly. Because if you have 5 slots, and you want to make sure good people who are otherwise unshowcased get in, it makes perfect logical sense to nominate 5 people. It doesn't have to be a deliberate attempt to make sure none of the Wrong Stuff gets in. It's about getting the Right Stuff in. Intentions matter, even if they're hard to discern. <br>

Which, functionally, no, I don't think is very different at all from 'Here are the things I and my friends are eligible for' or 'Here are the things I'm eligible for and the things I think are good." </i><br>
<br>
The difference between the two is that the former is trying to push writers out of the field on the basis of a falsehood, while the latter is expanding the field for underappreciated works. There is no SJW machine. (And when did 4chan become an authority in this matter?) There is a healthy level of debate and discussion, in which, the leading Puppy novel has sold more than the rest of the field combined. As you say, intentions matter, and the agenda of people who want Pink SF/insect army/termites out of "their" genre has been explicitly stated. <br>
<br>
Of course Jemisin didn't win a Hugo. Her novel made multiple voted and juried lists that year, so a fair number of people disagree with your perception of its quality.

I'm pretty sure it would be the latter, since the -o -onis family is more properly described as <em>io, ionis</em>.

Because if you have 5 slots, and you want to make sure good people who are otherwise unshowcased get in, it makes perfect logical sense to nominate 5 people.</i><br>
<br>
Explain how this results in John C. Wright taking up 3 spaces on the ballot for one category, then.<br>
<br>
I also would argue that your "campaigning for a SJW ballot" looks to me an awful lot like the kind of marketing that publishers <i>require</i> their authors to do.  Seanan McGuire/Mira Grant gets a lot of nominations because she writes a <i>lot</i> and she blogs a lot; so people recognize her name, and some of them buy her books, and report well of them, which encourages other people to buy them.  If her books were bad, no matter how popular a blogger she is, she wouldn't sell as well -- witness John C. Wright, who apparently has a committed fanbase, but doesn't sell nearly as well.  Or Jim C. Hines -- really nice guy, definitely an SJW-blogger, but hardly a best-seller, in part because IMO his work is fairly pedestrian. Great ideas, mediocre implementation.<br>
<br>
Scalzi is really good at getting his name out there, and while his books aren't really my beautiful cake, they certainly are for plenty of other people, and that's why he gets nominations.  <br>
<br>
N. K. Jemisin is <i>good at her job</i>; she writes essays and novels and does the business of marketing herself. That's what she's required to do as part of her job.  <br>
<br>
I don't think it's fair to claim that the kind of self-promotion necessary to survive as a fiction writer should be considered disqualifying when award season rolls around.<br>
<br>
And as noted <i>repeatedly</i> through this whole argument, there's a difference between saying, "I really liked this book and this book and this book, for these reasons, and I plan to nominate them for the Hugos," and "If we all vote exactly this way, those assholes on the other side of the river won't win anything."  <br>
<br>
Vote for love of a thing, not for spite.  The Puppies voted out of spite, and I would bet $100 that at least half of them didn't read any of the works they nominated.  It was all for politics.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999813" target="_self">11:26 AM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="5999825"></a><div class="comments">For a good few years I read almost nothing but science fiction and fantasy, heavy on the science fiction. I read a good number of terrible books which were nominated for a Hugo at one point or another. It would baffle me how they'd been nominated. The answer is simple, a non-trivial number of other people thought they deserved a nomination. "Hugo-worthy" isn't really an objective concept and any kind of logic based on wondering how a book you consider terrible was nominated isn't going to be very sturdy. That old parable of the house built on sand applies here.<br>
<br>
However, in the case of the Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies, we do have a different answer. A number of people organized a campaign to flood the award with votes for a full slate, drowning out other voices. The reason this particular case caused so much outrage is that we know why these works were nominated, and it doesn't fit with most people's conception of fairness. No, it's not technically in breach of the rules, but it's not ethical. The Hugos have been a fan-run award from the beginning, based on the idea that the fandom community rewards the works that most appeals to fans. If you mess with something like that, you should expect anger and outrage.

What is that zeitgeist? It is, in their own words (and scare quotes): <br>
<br>
<em>running effort to get stories, books, and people onto the Hugo ballot, who are entirely deserving, but who don’t usually get on the ballot. Largely because of the nomination and voting tendencies of World Science Fiction Convention, with its “fandom” community.</em><br>
<br>
What are those tendencies?  <br>
<br>
<em>In the last decade we’ve seen Hugo voting skew more and more toward literary (as opposed to entertainment) works.

Likewise, we’ve seen the Hugo voting skew ideological, as Worldcon and fandom alike have tended to use the Hugos as an affirmative action award: giving Hugos because a writer or artist is (insert underrepresented minority or victim group here) or because a given work features (insert underrepresented minority or victim group here) characters.</em><br>

<br>
I'm just really unsure how both of us can be looking at the same text, but seeing really different things. To me, that seems pretty clear - they think that the Hugos are starting to get overrun with affirmative action, which is a thing to be despised, and they want works that people other than ivory-tower academics will enjoy, because they feel SF/Fantasy were never really about the ivory tower academics in the first place and their arrival is recent. <br>
<br>
I fail to see how that's any different from people saying, "I'm tired of seeing these straight white guys overrunning the ballot, a thing to be despised, let's nominate people who are not white men so we can see works which are more important to niche communities within fandom other than the white men which tbh do dominate fandom and cons and have for the last fifty years, because fandom is never about the white guy's voice and always had a higher ideal."<br>
<br>
They are two halves of the same coin. <br>
<br>
It's incredibly rare that people voluntarily put on black hats and twirl their moustaches just to be jerks. And if you look at the <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/">Sad Puppies slate</a>, the self-professed reasoning is pretty much exactly as I lay it out: <blockquote> Not an absolute. Gathered here is <strong>the best list (we think!) of entirely deserving works, writers, and editors — all of whom would not otherwise find themselves on the Hugo ballot without some extra oomph</strong> received from beyond the rarefied, insular halls of 21st century Worldcon “fandom.”</blockquote>

This is functionally identical, from a different perspective, to "Here is the best list of authors of color, who would not find themselves being read/ on the Hugo Ballot without some signal boost, because the insular halls of SF/Fantasy are overwhelmingly white." And if you look at things like the 50 Books POC challenge, where people are explicitly trying to read, review, (and often, nom) books by authors of color, these are all<a href="http://rachelmanija.livejournal.com/693817.html"> things that have been said before.</a><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999942" target="_self">12:28 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
Actually it's a combination of A + B. I think, first and most importantly, that it's quite possible a lot of people like their writing because they're willing to accept lower standards for things that ping their buttons, whether they be diversity or otherwise - just like, as I noted, Sad Puppies likely did with Tom Kratman and his Islamic Dystopia fiction. Hell, I do it myself with Regency Romance and Hermione/Snape fanfiction, my own trashy loves. It is a thing that happens to people. It is possible for people to have a genuine true belief in something without it being a justified true belief, and it's possible for people not even to be totally aware of how their beliefs are impacting their choices/voting. <br>
<br>
I don't think that the voting was purely based on ideology, but I think that when people haven't read works, they tend to vote - on both sides! for recognizable names. And again, I'm not pointing fingers there - this is something that when I get lazy, I'd be likely to do myself. I probably won't do it this year because this is such a Big Thing, but in other years looking at this slate, I could totally see myself saying, "Oh man, I haven't gotten a chance to read that John C Wright thing, but he is pretty damn good at other stuff, so you know what, I'll tick his box." And that can also apply to, "I haven't really read much Jemisin/McGuire, but I saw her swinging for our side, and I don't really know the other guys, so I'll throw a vote her way." <br>
<br>
Does that make more sense?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5999953" target="_self">12:34 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

Sure. And that would be relevant if that were something that were happening here.

<br>
Ancillary Sword outsold everything except for Skin Game according to estimated sales figures. Goblin Emperor's sales are on par with three of the Puppy novels. So which ones are the ivory-tower academic nominations? Neither strike me as particularly literary or ivory-tower-ish. I don't know how space opera and political fantasy are "niche."

<br>
Hm. Her <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/138919/Velveteen-vs-The-Front-Page-Post">Velveteen</a> stories really are something special to me: warm, moving, thoughtful, inventive, funny, and very, very attuned to superhero comics as a genre. I haven't had the same experience of one of her novel series yet, but I reserve judgment until I see more than the first volume of each, because they've mostly felt like "pilot" episodes and I know for sure that she's capable of amazing things. <br>
<br>
I also think it's pretty ungenerous to paint her many Hugo nominations as the product of "aggressive" self-promotion. She goes to Worldcons. She sings funny songs and entertains people. Her panel comments are witty and insightful. She writes things a lot of people like. I feel pretty sure Worldcon attendees remember her well enough, regardless of what she writes on LJ.<br>
<br>
If you want to pick on someone for being well-liked by Hugo voters, maybe pick on Robert Silverberg--much-liked as a character at Worldcon and nominated for Best Novel <em>nine</em> times ... but he never took the prize in that category. It's maybe a reminder that the Hugo Awards are inextricably bound to a social event. <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0507/ref.shtml">Here's</a> Silverberg reflecting on the first Worldcon in London, and he mentions having attended <em>fifty</em> Worldcons. His schtick at the Hugo Awards ceremony is pretty funny--very dry. He also writes things a lot of people like. Is it really a surprise that Worldcon attendees rewarded him with nominations?<br>
<br>
If you want there to be an award that eliminates social effects on literary judgments, you should go create one and figure out how to administer it, because the Hugos have always been an honor bestowed by the attendees of Worldcon. They're literary awards but also the focus of the biggest event at the convention, and I suspect people in attendance mostly just want to be happy and cheer for one or two favorites that made it through the process. They're also fairly administered and open to anyone who'd like to join in the fun. But for the next two years, at least, these sociopaths have made it impossible for anyone in attendance to cheer for anything but <em>their</em> favorites.

Gathered here is the best list (we think!) of entirely deserving works, writers, and editors — all of whom would not otherwise find themselves on the Hugo ballot without some extra oomph received from beyond the rarefied, insular halls of 21st century Worldcon “fandom.”</i><br>
<br>
Here's the thing, corb: that list was compiled from dozens of nominations submitted to VD and BT, with no single work being nominated more than 3 times.  VD/BT decided which works from each category would be chosen for the slate.  <br>
<br>
The slate wasn't compiled using run-off voting, so that the relevant community members would have a chance to compare one work to another.  Dozens of nominated works, but only five made the slate, and I doubt VD or BT read everything that their fans submitted.  They cherry-picked a slate and had all of their Puppies nominate ONLY what was on the slate.  All actual decision-making was done ONLY by VD and BT, not by the individual Puppy nominators.<br>
<br>
The result is that works that even VD/BT like, like <i>The Three-Body Problem</i> or the Heinlein biography, didn't make the Hugo nominations, because the slate forced them off.  <br>
<br>
They deprived other Hugo nominators of the opportunity to nominate works they themselves would have voted for but forgot to include.  <br>
<br>
The worst thing is the slate deprived their own community of like-minded folks the opportunity to vote their own preferences.  <br>
<br>
The problem with slate voting isn't the politics of the party engaging in it.  Isn't the spiteful purpose behind this instance.  It's that slate voting <i>removes the voter's individual choice</i> from the process, and delegates it to someone else.  That the voter apparently agrees to it doesn't make it any more democratic.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000006" target="_self">12:52 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="6000007"></a><div class="comments">The reason the Hugo nominations are so easy to game this way is that they are decided by:<br>
<br>
1) An extremely small number of voters,<br>
2) With a very low entry barrier for participation,<br>
3) Making choices out of an extremely large pool,<br>
4) With few restrictions on number of works an individual can nominate.<br>
<br>
Combined, they mean that whipping up a crowd to dominate the nomination process is pretty easy.  But it's not an unfixable problem, if the people in charge decide they want to fix it.  Votes for the actual award, as opposed to the nomination, are harder to game (although it's still possible), simply because only one of these factors has changed (number of choices being voted on.)<br>
<br>
Vastly increasing the number of voters is perhaps the ideal solution but hard to pull off.  Raising the entry barrier for participation (such as the "four-year Wordcom member if nonattending" suggestion made by Iridic above) would make gaming the system harder, but will probably not sit well with the people who have been trying to expand the number of voters for many years.<br>
<br>
So, one solution might be to use the same method that makes it harder to game the awards themselves -- reduce the candidate pool for nominations.  Set up a system of several stages, so that (at least) first a long list gets nominated, then a short list is selected from the long list.<br>
<br>
People could still campaign for a slate, but it would be harder to dominate because non-slate votes would get more and more concentrated at each step.  In theory, unless your slate voters are literally the majority of voters period, in which case you're winning no matter what, it's harder to take control.<br>
<br>
Another, not mutually exclusive with the first and much easier to implement, would be to limit the number of nominations an individual can make in a given category.  If an individual can only vote for one book as a best novel nomination, then a slate can gather behind a single book, but it's much harder to dominate a single category.<br>
<br>
Honestly, though, I don't expect we'll see changes anytime soon, if ever.  Institutional momentum is hard to overcome.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000007" target="_self">12:52 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

Or Scalzi.  I absolutely believe <i>Redshirts</i> won the Hugo because Scalzi is hugely popular; I found the book to be both slight and forgettable.

<br>
I don't want to be rude, here, but do you not get how slate voting works?<br>
<br>
The only way the slate won is that every single Puppy nominated ONLY the works that VD/BT told them to list. Not the works the individual Puppy liked best, or even the works that the individual Puppy offered for the Puppy slate.<br>
<br>
<i>The Puppies did not vote their own individual choices.  They voted the way they were told to.</i><br>
<br>
People voting for Scalzi are doing so for their own reasons, and maybe some of those reasons have less to do with literary quality than we would like: but each individual got to make their own decision about that.  And, hopefully, most of them read the works they were voting for.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000070" target="_self">1:16 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

Yes, this.  I got tired of seeing the same old names on the ballot every year, because it seemed like people were just nominating out of familiarity rather than actual quality.  Last year was a nice change, because I saw books &amp; names that were new, and seemed to show an interest in fresh blood--an interest in quality &amp; originality over familiarity.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000088" target="_self">1:25 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

Doesn't the same also apply to Sad Puppies voters though? Some of them probably did vote in lockstep, but if so, no one held a gun to their head. They decided for their own reasons that they wanted to vote in the slate, and many of those reasons may have less to do with literary quality than we would like, but every individual did get to make their own decision about whether or not to participate - or whether or not to mostly participate with some small variance.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000100" target="_self">1:32 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

At the risk of repeating myself, it's not about conservatives <em>per se</em>. After all, they tried it last year and failed. What sane, compassionate, and (most importantly) non-racist/sexist/etc fans would have done is maybe tried to fix the nomination process or something. Instead, they chose a group of people that they figured would piss of the sane, etc. fans as nominees, invited a massive group of violent thugs for whom gatekeeping fandoms is a full-time job to rig the system, and then chortled with glee when their tactic worked (even though it occasionally worked against them). <br>
<br>
And for the umpteenth time: the fact that conservatives did this as a bloc isn't the fault of liberals or "SJWs." It's the fault of conservatives operating as a bloc instead of individuals.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000111" target="_self">1:37 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

No, it doesn't. We keep explaining exactly why this is a different situation.

The parallel would work if Madison (with some eager assistance from Candace, who was kicked off the school newspaper for one too many white supremacist editorials) took advantage of a loophole in prom court nominations to ensure that the final ballot consists only of<br>
<br>
1: Madison<br>
2: Candace<br>
3: Madison's bestie Janelle, who believes Christ was murdered by the Jews<br>
4: "Lexy? You know, <em>Lexy</em>. From Future Leaders? I know she's questionable queen material <em>at best</em>, let's be honest, but at least she's not one of those bitches from Service Club or Prism."<br>
5. Janelle again<br>

This, to me, is not a demonstrated and verified fact - not only that, I don't think it's true at all. I don't think most of the writing on the Sad Puppies slate is misogynist or racist or homophobic, and would <em>challenge you to demonstrate otherwise</em> - not to demonstrate that <em>some</em> of the authors held some such views, but that the writing itself is that way as a requirement for inclusion on the slate. And I don't think that's possible to do. I mean,Guardians of the Galaxy?

<blockquote>That’s what’s happened to Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy literature. A few decades ago, if you saw a lovely spaceship on a book cover, with a gorgeous planet in the background, you could be pretty sure you were going to get a rousing space adventure featuring starships and distant, amazing worlds. If you saw a barbarian swinging an axe? You were going to get a rousing fantasy epic with broad-chested heroes who slay monsters, and run off with beautiful women. Battle-armored interstellar jump troops shooting up alien invaders? Yup. A gritty military SF war story, where the humans defeat the odds and save the Earth. And so on, and so forth.<br>
<br>
These days, you can’t be sure.<br>
<br>
The book has a spaceship on the cover, but is it really going to be a story about space exploration and pioneering derring-do? Or is the story merely about racial prejudice and exploitation, with interplanetary or interstellar trappings?<br>
<br>
There’s a sword-swinger on the cover, but is it really about knights battling dragons? Or are the dragons suddenly the good guys, and the sword-swingers are the oppressive colonizers of Dragon Land?<br>
<br>
A planet, framed by a galactic backdrop. Could it be an actual bona fide space opera? Heroes and princesses and laser blasters? No, wait. It’s about sexism and the oppression of women.<br>
<br>
Finally, a book with a painting of a person wearing a mechanized suit of armor! Holding a rifle! War story ahoy! Nope, wait. It’s actually about gay and transgender issues.<br>
<br>
Or it could be about the evils of capitalism and the despotism of the wealthy.<br>
<br>
Do you see what I am trying to say here?</blockquote>

		<a name="6000141"></a><div class="comments">corb, the votes of the Rabid Sad Puppies were acknowledged to have nothing to do with literary quality, or personal preference.  That is the way a slate works.  <br>
<br>
Individually, the Puppies would not have voted for the works they nominated as part of a slate. They gave up their individual preferences in order to vote the slate.<br>
<br>
I think this is undemocratic, especially when the voting involves works of art.  All we really have, in the end, is subjective preference when looking at art, and the Puppies threw that overboard to make a political point.<br>
<br>
<i>I don't think most of the writing on the Sad Puppies slate is misogynist or racist or homophobic</i><br>
<br>
That's not why they voted for them.  They voted for those works--including at least one story by a woman who claims to be a socialist--because that way they got to keep Scalzi, Jemisin,  and other perceived social-justice types <i>off the ballot</i>.<br>

<br>
That elides over the crucial step of reading the darn book. The process is not (1) author does cool stuff then (2) author gets votes. It's (1) author does cool stuff, (2) <em>author gets readers</em>, then (3) author gets votes. <br>
<br>
A lot of us, myself included, keep bringing up nominators not reading the works they nominated. So let's look at a timeline:<br>
<br>
January 7: Torgersen <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/01/07/announcing-sad-puppies-3/">begins taking suggestions</a> for the slate. As suelac pointed out, a consensus did not emerge in the comments.<br>
February 1: Torgersen first <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/">announces the SP3 slate</a>; it starts out incomplete<br>
March 2: Torgersen finalizes the SP3 slate.<br>
March 10: Last day to nominate works<br>
<br>
There are 38 days between February 1 and March 10. For the SP nominators to make informed choices, they'd need to read five novels, three novellas, five novelettes, five short stories, three books and two essays in the related work category, and one webcomic collection. Not to mention watching five movies and five TV shows, and listening to various episodes of three podcasts. <em>And</em> forming an opinion on the abilities of eight editors, the quality of several zines, and so forth.<br>
<br>
And all of that in under forty days. <br>
<br>
That's hugely different than using fandom popularity to build readership, which then earns you votes.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000146" target="_self">1:51 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="6000151"></a><div class="comments">It's may not be meant to reflect misogyny or racism or homophobic writing itself, but it's obvious that that happens to be a bonus for them. And it certainly is about fighting back against feminists and PoC and LGBT. Here's Torgersen in his own words:
<blockquote>A few decades ago, if you saw a lovely spaceship on a book cover, with a gorgeous planet in the background, you could be pretty sure you were going to get a rousing space adventure featuring starships and distant, amazing worlds. If you saw a barbarian swinging an axe? You were going to get a rousing fantasy epic with broad-chested heroes who slay monsters, and run off with beautiful women. Battle-armored interstellar jump troops shooting up alien invaders? Yup. A gritty military SF war story, where the humans defeat the odds and save the Earth. And so on, and so forth.<br>
<br>
These days, you can’t be sure.<br>
<br>
The book has a spaceship on the cover, but is it really going to be a story about space exploration and pioneering derring-do? Or is the story merely about racial prejudice and exploitation, with interplanetary or interstellar trappings?<br>
<br>
There’s a sword-swinger on the cover, but is it really about knights battling dragons? Or are the dragons suddenly the good guys, and the sword-swingers are the oppressive colonizers of Dragon Land?<br>
<br>
A planet, framed by a galactic backdrop. Could it be an actual bona fide space opera? Heroes and princesses and laser blasters? No, wait. It’s about sexism and the oppression of women.<br>
<br>
Finally, a book with a painting of a person wearing a mechanized suit of armor! Holding a rifle! War story ahoy! Nope, wait. It’s actually about gay and transgender issues.<br>
<br>
Or it could be about the evils of capitalism and the despotism of the wealthy.<br>
<br>
Do you see what I am trying to say here?<br>
<br>
Our once reliable packaging has too often defrauded our readership.</blockquote>

Of course, the moment they asked people invested in misogyny and racism and homophobia to crash the party, there was no explaining away that that's not what they support.<br>

		<a name="6000167"></a><div class="comments"><em>There would be no reason to get upset about it [...] unless it's being viewed, like that piece by Justin Landon, as some sort of battle for the soul of science fiction</em><br>
<br>
Worldcons have always relied on poor sampling, both to reflect the interests of the folks who come to the big show to cheer for their favorites and to reflect what's going on in the field of SF/F. That's neither a reason to place limits on simple reminders of how many works of SF/F have been published in a year nor a reason to make the selection bias on the ballot much, much worse.<br>
<br>
However, what's going on at this point does not strike me as a battle. If it were, the puppies would lose badly. I think Sasquan has tons of options to be seriously aggressive here. They could do things like cancel the reading packet to avoid giving the puppies a platform, immediately stop allowing supporting memberships, shorten the voting period, cancel the Hugo ceremony and just announce the results with no fanfare, set up an alternative award (not a Hugo) and use the full voting period to let people vote on a slate that coincidentally includes all the nominees that would have made it without any puppies on the ballot, or just set up an alternative award to be given equally to the top five candidates (minus puppy candidates) from every category. Etc., etc. They could invite a diverse and obviously left-wing panel of judges to give a new jury prize (though not a Hugo), and change the Hugo statue's base design to include a giant, crudely-rendered middle finger. They do have to run a vote based on the puppies' nominees and give out Hugos based on the results, but I'm not aware that they have to play nice about it.<br>
<br>
But there's no battle, and I'm pretty sure that what you're going to see instead is that the awards will be routine and conducted with simple impartiality, because Worldcon is one of the most socially staid and non-radical shows going. When I went two years ago, what I saw was Elizabeth Moon and Elizabeth Bear (both past targets in kerfuffles you've mentioned) pleasantly talking to a huge crowd about writing combat scenes. I saw industry diversity cabalist Patrick Nielsen Hayden cheerfully accepting the Prometheus Award for Libertarian SF on behalf of an author he edits. The <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/142334/Its-okay-because-someday-theyll-all-be-dead">generation gap</a> at Worldcon is fairly notorious, and I saw that too. It's not even slightly radical--it's just a bunch of people trying to enjoy their hobby and/or collegial relationships for a weekend. But everyone there voting "No Award" for a bunch of stuff foisted on them primarily by non-attending $40 members is a reasonably kind outcome, because even very gentle people can be ugly when they become a disappointed crowd in a big room together, listening to "honors" being given that they had essentially nothing to do with.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/93769" target="_self">Monsieur Caution</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000167" target="_self">2:02 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

I want to be able to say that the Hugos at least reflect the lowest-common-denominator agreement on the best the field has to offer in the last year.  And this ballot fails entirely to do that.<br>

<ol>
<li>Provide a platform for conservative works, particularly those that are hostile towards so-called SJWs</li>
<li>Deny SJWs the opportunity to nominate their own works. Or, put another way, ensure that the slots that don't go to conservative works don't go towards liberal works either.</li>
<li>Provide plausible deniability that promoting conservatism is the primary goal.</li>
</ol>

Items 2 and 3 are how you end up with things like the Lego Movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the zombie comic. <br>
<br>
It's not that being conservative is an absolute requirement for entry onto the slate. As corb rightly points out, that's not the case. But ideology is absolutely the motivating factor, and even the non-ideological (and occasional leftist) works are there to further the conservative motivations for the slate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000175" target="_self">2:07 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="6000188"></a><div class="comments"><em>  Here's Torgersen in his own words...Our once reliable packaging has too often defrauded our readership.</em><br>
<br>
This is a really great example of how two people can read the same thing and get different answers. Because to me, it doesn't seem like Torgensen is saying, "Man, I hate stories about POC/LGBT individuals." It seems, to me, like he's saying, 'Let science fiction be what it says on the damn box.'<br>
<br>
And that's a view I have a lot of sympathy for, because - though I don't think it's the fault of the authors - he is 100% right about how the publishers are advertising these stories. It's something even the authors of those stories have been complaining about - that, say, <a href="http://www.yalsa.ala.org/thehub/2012/12/10/it-matters-if-youre-black-or-white-the-racism-of-ya-book-covers/">the character will be a person of color, but the cover picture is blond and blue eyed.</a> Publishing houses are in no way advertising, "A ripping tale of exploitation and racism." To take the aforementioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316043923/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="0316043923">Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</a> -<em> whether you think it is a good book or a bad book</em> - the cover shows no character at all, and the writeup in no way mentions racism, slavery, or class issues. The blurb reads as though it were a traditional coming of age inheritance story. Hell, you would not even get the idea from the blurb or the cover that the main character was a POC at all.<br>
<br>
And beyond that - things generally are shelved with the books that are the preponderance of their material. For example: many if not most fantasy stories contain a romance. But they're not shelved with romance, because the romance is simply a part of the expected story, rather than the focal point of the story. If your romance is the focal point of the story and the fantasy trappings are window dressing, your story belongs in the romance category. Similarly, if the purpose of your writing is to talk about race-related issues, with dragons as window dressing, then your writing should be shelved with other fiction dealing with race-related issues. When your writing is shelved with fantasy, people have a right to expect that the world will be mainly fantasy related.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000188" target="_self">2:13 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
Delany comes to mind. So does leGuin. <i>Brave New World</i> had seriously political things to say. Heinlein was explicitly political. Those... shouldn't be shelved with SF/F? What about <i>Dune</i><br>
<br>
<i>The blurb reads as though it were a traditional coming of age inheritance story. Hell, you would not even get the idea from the blurb or the cover that the main character was a POC at all.</i><br>
<br>
Oh, there's the answer. Because 'traditional' means 'white.' Because for some reason readers have to be told just in case--gasp, let me clutch my pearls for a moment--there's a POC character in the book. Because you have <i>completely missed</i> that Torgenson's steaming pile about book covers is purely window dressing for whining and complaining that someone dared to get peanut butter in his chocolate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/190387" target="_self">feckless fecal fear mongering</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000199" target="_self">2:18 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
What it seems to me he is saying is, "It's not SF if it's about POC/LGBT people."  Because according to him, even if it IS a space opera with FTL drives and galaxy-spanning empires, it doesn't count if the main character doesn't know or care what gender anyone else is, and so calls everyone "she" by default.<br>
<br>
Any interest in social issues, to Torgensen, is enough to make it NOT SF.<br>
<br>
Which is bullshit gate-keeping.  He may not like it, but it's still legitimately part of the genre.<br>
<br>
And I'm not clear why you think Jemisin's books are required to have POC on the cover (as compared to not having any individuals at all).  I suspect this is a marketing decision, to keep people from doing what Torgensen would do -- not pick it up because they don't want to read books about brown people.<br>
<br>
Really, corb, your concern about Jemisin is beginning to look kind of creepy.  We get you didn't like the Inheritance Trilogy.

Or actually read the cover you linked to on Hundred Thousand Kingdoms? The tagline, "Gods and mortals, power and love, death and revenge. She will inherit them all."<br>
<br>
Or how about the library review blurb which is second on the back cover, "Debut author Jemisin creates a mesmerizing exotic world were fallen gods <i>serve as slaves to the ruling class</i> and murder and ambition go hand in hand." (Jemisin has commented that fans frequently misread the protagonist's ethnicity.) <br>
<br>
While we're namedropping people older than Torgersen, let's go back to the roots: Lovecraft, Stoker, and Wells all had different issues regarding race in their works. For that matter, the godfather of swashbuckling adventure, Alexandre Dumas, pere was certainly dancing around ideas (within the limits of publication) about what it meant to be French given the his family history.  <br>

<br>
And where in the bookstore is that, exactly? <br>
<br>
Surely if somebody would have a race-related issues in fiction section, it would be Powell's. <a href="http://www.powells.com/images/BURN-MAP-2014-01.jpg">So let's have a look</a>. There's African-American studies, which is non-fiction. Sociology? Non-fiction, too. (So are the feminist studies and gay and lesbian sections.)<br>
<br>
But all the fiction is divvied up by genre: science fiction, westerns, true crime, literature, etc. Which is as it should be. <br>
<br>
Like everyone else, I want to be represented in the fiction I read. And I want my friends and loved ones represented, too. Which means discussing race, class, queer and trans issues, disabilities, and so forth. Those issues are going to take centre stage in fiction that represents us, because they take centre stage in our lives. And none of us lead single-issue lives, and our stories can't be shelved in a single-issue section of a bookstore.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000235" target="_self">2:37 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
It's interesting that that has come out as a tagline, but I think it really exemplifies the different sorts of SF fan divergences that you're having. I mean, the stereotypical thing is 'Oh everyone loves Star Trek' but you know, not everyone loves some of the more liberal themes of Star Trek (noninterference, etc), and I would not categorize Star Trek as Golden Age SF at all. I mean, I'm sure they can't say that because it would provoke a fight, but the themes of Golden Age SF tended to be more about colonization than about peacefully wandering the galaxy without having humans triumph. <br>
<br>
And yes, you can say that that is political as well because it was all created in a climate where colonization could be seen as unproblematic, and that is a real and valid critique - but I do think there's a difference between politics that are kind of baked in by culture and politics that are explicitly trying to change the culture. I mean, that's the point of a lot of the critiques, right? That the status quo is inherently X-ist because of its acculturization?<br>
<br>
And what Correia at least <a href="http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/04/04/sad-puppies-update-the-nominees-announced-and-why-i-refused-my-nomination/">says he wants</a> is a time where people could just write what they wanted without having to worry about whether or not their writing was politically correct (I mean, pro tip of course, it was not) <blockquote>In the long term I want writers to be free to write whatever they want without fear of social justice witch hunts, I want creators to not have to worry about silencing themselves to appease the perpetually outraged, and I want fans to enjoy themselves without having some entitled snob lecture them about how they are having fun wrong. I want our shrinking genre to grow. I think if we can get back to where “award nominated” isn’t a synonym for “preachy crap” to the most fans, we’ll do it.</blockquote>

And you know, again, I think a lot of the stuff I read is stuff that some of these guys would turn their nose up and/or be <em>horrified</em> by (I'm looking at you, Sirius/Remus fic), but I understand on a visceral level what he means, because it's a thing that's been affecting other genres as well. I'm frustrated and tired with my fantasy kingdom novels suddenly being more concerned about the welfare of the servants than with the knights and kings. I'm frustrated and tired with my Regency Romance novels suddenly starting to include diatribes about how Gunters Ices are made with slave sugar, or how seamstresses are going blind on embroidery for the pretty dresses. I'm frustrated and tired with people insisting that lady-written slashfiction on AO3 is somehow anti-gay because it is written by women not men. I am, to be completely frank, tired of preachy crap. I will read books about POC and LGBT and disabled characters with glee, but I don't want to read books filled with preachy crap. If I wanted to read preachy crap I would go to my nonfiction shelf.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000263" target="_self">2:48 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
Right, but how do you show that on a paperback cover?  Because that's the most important thing, according to Torgensen.  Gotta warn him about the default feminine pronoun!<br>
<br>
This reminds me of the fannish argument for content warnings, because it's impossible to properly warn for everything that someone might possibly object to in a story.  Similarly, it's impossible to signal everything about a novel that someone might possibly want to know in advance, not without spoiling the reading experience completely.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000267" target="_self">2:49 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

This is such an odd response to me, given that essentially the nomination process has been entirely hijacked by Vox Day. The categories for novellas, novelettes, short stories, related work, editor short-form and editor long-form are all entirely made up of Vox Day's personal picks. So in effect, people who will vote in these categories are taking part in Hugo Award categories where Vox Day controlled the nominations.

		<a name="6000403"></a><div class="comments">So upthread, I was questioning just how many people actually read Letters from Gardner. Well, it turns out that one person who did was Ken Burnside, another nominee for Best Related Work. (He wrote the thermodynamics essay.) Here's <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/04/04/a-note-about-the-hugo-nominations-this-year/#comment-780251">what he said about the category</a>, on Scalzi's blog:
<blockquote>

...there’s a piece that’s clearly head-and-shoulders better than anyone else’s, mine, and three pieces that are all expressions of “let’s make sure that the people we dislike know we like making them uncomfortable.”</blockquote>

The piece that's clearly better? It's Letters from Gardner. I'll take Burnside's word that it's excellent — after all, he's read it and I haven't. And what's frustrating to me is that it seems like exactly the kind of worthy-but-underappreciated work that the "hey, check this out" Hugo blog posts shine their lights on. But now it's tainted by association with the three other pieces motivated purely by animosity, and by association with all the other nastiness in the slate. Maybe it will get evaluated on its merits and win, maybe it won't<sup>*</sup>. Speaking for myself, I don't see anything odious about that book on the surface but, honestly, it's gonna be hard to push the thought that "Vox Day saw something great in this" completely out of my mind when I read it.<br>
<br>
It makes me imagine an alternate-universe puppy recommendation list where Torgersen and Day didn't use scorched earth tactics. Maybe that would have resulted in more people actually approaching under-appreciated works with an open mind. Which was allegedly the point.<br>

		<a name="6000432"></a><div class="comments">I had to look at that blog twice to make sure that it was satirical.  That's how far gone this whole thing is.<br>
<br>
If Fred Phelps pulls a reverse L. Ron -- going from questionable religion to questionable sci-fi -- and unexpectedly pens and publishes a marvelous sci-fi/fantasy novel, should it be entered into consideration next year?  Does an author's character -- or inarguable lack thereof -- enter the debate, or is it strictly based on the written work itself?<br>
<br>
Three other space opera novellas emerge with similar levels of acclaim.  One is particularly sensitive to issues of race, sexual politics and gender.  One makes the <a href="http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/people/merritt/books/Eye_of_Argon.html">Eye of Argon</a> (<small><i>[Crow T. Robot] A slut? Where?</i></small>) seem enlightened on those themes.  The third is somewhat agnostic on those themes and wholly revolves around galactic conquest and laser battles et al.  Should #1 get bonus points for sensitivity and #2 penalties for adhering to cliched preconceptions of sci-fi?  Or, as the Puppies would argue, should that put #2 ABOVE #1 in and of itself?  Or is #3 the better work for dodging that firefight altogether?<br>
<br>
It's hard enough to judge a subjective contest like writing quality under good and clearly defined circumstances, and the Hugo award maintainers will have to think long and hard as to what they'll have to do to define all of the above more clearly.  It's going to take a lot of reformation of the process for the Hugos to be viewed as anything but a hot mess for years to come.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20949" target="_self">delfin</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000432" target="_self">4:00 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
I think that, ideally, the quality of the work should be all that matters for awards. Now, when it comes to whether or not I choose to <em>read</em> the book, I may or may not let the author's politics enter into it. I might read stuff from authors with politics I don't like if I like their stuff or I might say "Eh, life is short and there are more books that I want to read out there. It won't hurt me to skip this one by Bigname Homophobe". I reserve the right to be completely inconsistent about this, too.<br>
<br>
This does mean that a great work might not be nominated/chosen because people decide that they aren't going to read it because the author is a racist, homophobe, pinko-commie, or just has poor hygiene. So it goes. That's the way it is with popularity contests.<br>
<br>
So, if John Wright's stuff really is great then it should be nominated. I may decide not to read it, because he's a bigot. I may decide to read it, despite his being a bigot. This may mean that a book/short story that I would normally agree is one of the best of the year doesn't get a vote from me because I've decided the author is an ass. One way around that is to stop being an ass. Or just be a little quieter about it.<br>
<br>
I guess this was easier back in the pre-internet days when you knew nothing about your author beyond where they were born and that they wrote books. It was a little safer to be disagreeable because no one knew. Now you have a blog and if you don't like kids, cats, guns, gays, women, or the French, everyone knows.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/108265" target="_self">It's Never Lurgi</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000466" target="_self">4:15 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

		<a name="6000487"></a><div class="comments">well, I was in a pretty thought-provoking discussion a few months ago with some friends over dinner, about <em>Ender's Game</em>, and specifically whether the ending (in which, spoilers for a 40 year old Hugo winner, a supposed simulated war game in which the protagonist succeeds in wiping out an entire alien race turns out to have been real) read more to us as (a) a cheap way to absolve an Ubermensch hero of responsibility (or at least complicity) in genocide or (b) a sharply-pointed damnation of the military-industrial complex and its exploitation of the people it nominally protects. The discussion itself only lightly touched on what OSC's own politics are.<br>
<br>
Likewise, pretty much everyone acknowledges that the giants of the genre--Asimov, Heinlein, etc.--wrote down some astoundingly sexist/racist/homophobic/otherwise kyriarchical stuff, while also being extremely enlightened on certain points, often in the same works. So it's not all about character, and I don't think anyone proposed it should be, or that the goal is works that are entirely unproblematic. But I also think it shows a lack of imagination and laziness to fall back on the same sexist/racist/etc. tropes that are prevalent not just in old science fiction, but throughout culture in general.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/117509" target="_self">kagredon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000487" target="_self">4:24 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

And let's just admit that finding covers that were certain to have been around then is too big a pain in the ass to actually check, so I'm mostly just going to guess from the cover art.<br>
<br>
Spaceships and/or exotic planets:  That includes The Dispossessed and The LEft Hand of Darkness, oops.  It includes The Forever War.  Oops.  It includes Consider Phlebas, oops.  It includes some covers of Imperial Earth and its bi main character (sort of; it's vaguely implied that everyone is bi).  If you can wait a couple of years, it includes Use of Weapons, whose original cover features a spaceship/plane actually attacking things and blowing them up.  And Red Mars!<br>
<br>
Barbarian swinging an axe:  well, that includes Moorcock, who I don't think he'd be thrilled with.  If we extend this to other fantasy cover tropes, we end up with the Thomas Covenant books about rape and betrayal and disbelief.  Hell, there are covers for Babel-17 that are almost like that.<br>
<br>
Or, say, books with dragons -- oh yeah, that includes the Dragonriders of Pern with all that gay sex that's only barely kept off the page.  And the dragons are heroes instead of being killed by the heroes!  Oh the humanities!<br>
<br>
Battle-armored space marines:  Forever War again.  Also Armor.<br>

		<a name="6000569"></a><div class="comments">The Hugo's always been a strange beast. My wife once asked me how it was determined and I told her it the nominations were voted on by the attending and supporting members of the previous and upcoming Worldcons, with the winners voted on by the attending and supporting members of the upcoming Worldcon. And she gave me the "quit with the obvious nonsense and give me a straight answer" look that I sometimes deserve and I had to insist that this wasn't one of those times.<br>
<br>
"So it's just whoever felt like going to Worldcon that year?"<br>
<br>
"Yup."<br>
<br>
So there have always been selection biases of the voting body based on money and geography. And hardly anyone nominates, especially for short fiction, with a handful of votes separating the nominees from the runners-up for nomination. And there's a profound effect for the rich to get richer in terms of nominees in that the recent work the most people are most likely to be familiar with is by people they already like enough that they promptly read their new works. <br>
<br>
The Australian ballot system for determining the winner produces a winner that's <a href="http://australianpolitics.com/voting/electoral-system/preferential-voting">the least disliked</a> among the nominees, with the nominee that received the most votes for number one sometimes losing. (I'm not saying that's a terrible thing -- I basically like the Australian ballot -- I'm just noting it as one more detail as to how the results can be odd.)<br>
<br>
I think it's pretty obvious that some works won as sorts of lifetime achievement awards for popular writers despite the winning work itself being weaker than its co-nominees. It's pretty inevitable, after all, that the winners of popular votes go to popular writers.<br>
<br>
And it's been obvious that essentially buying a nomination (especially for the short fiction categories) wouldn't be that hard a trick, with buying the award also being possible. I suppose it was just a matter of time before the process was so thoroughly gamed.<br>
<br>
I'm not seeing any way back. Maybe it's just sadness in the moment and maybe I'll change my mind about this with some more time to reflect, but right now I'm feeling like maybe it's time for the Hugos to die. The field's pretty cluttered with awards anyway.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12683" target="_self">Zed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000569" target="_self">4:58 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

<br>
Apropos of mistaking the color of a character, I probably read LeGuin's Earthsea books half a dozen times without realizing that the main character wasn't white. O.o  When someone mentioned that during a discussion of the SyFy channel series, I was dumbfounded.  I went back and read it again and damn, it's right there.  I just missed it, multiple times.<br>
<br>
Of course, learning this fact made not even a tiny bit of difference in my enjoyment of the books.  I just had to edit my mental images. That took a little work, but I was up to it.<br>
<br>
I'm an old cis het white woman, been reading SF/F for 50 years.  I'm enjoying the new viewpoints of PoC characters, non-cis/het characters. They have viewpoints that I DON'T KNOW from my own experience. Gives me a different kind of sensawunda.<br>

If you saw a barbarian swinging an axe? You were going to get a rousing fantasy epic with broad-chested heroes who slay monsters, and run off with beautiful women. Battle-armored interstellar jump troops shooting up alien invaders? Yup. A gritty military SF war story, where the humans defeat the odds and save the Earth. And so on, and so forth.</em><br>
<br>
As a long-time sci-fi fan, this makes no sense to me. I started with Arthur C Clarke and Heinlien, sure. But a spaceship could also mean Bradbury, who's space stories were more poetic and nostalgic than 'adventurous'. Or it could mean the subversive space opera of M. John Harrison or Samuel Delaney. Once you're into sci-fi, it's pretty easy to spot and avoid the purely jingoistic MilScifi stuff. It's also weird that they say 'a few decades ago', since my preferred flavor of sci-fi, New Wave, dates from the 60s and was an explicit rejection of everything these dinosaurs stand for. <br>
<br>
Phil Sandifer did a <a href="http://www.philipsandifer.com/2015/04/podcasting-about-hugos.html">podcast</a> and a <a href="http://www.philipsandifer.com/2015/04/the-day-fandom-ended.html">blog</a> on the topic.<br>
<br>
That's where I first heard of this, but he paints it in starker terms:<br>
<br>
<em>Theodore Beale opposes women's suffrage, saying, "the women of America would do well to consider whether their much-cherished gains of the right to vote, work, murder and freely fornicate are worth destroying marriage, children, civilized Western society and little girls." He believes that black people are less human than white people, saying of a black woman that "genetic science presently suggests that we are not equally homo sapiens sapiens."<br>
<br>
I admit that these two quotes leave me slightly uncertain as to what to say. They are, obviously, preposterously vile things to say. But they are so vile that they defy the usual rhetoric with which we respond to loathsome views. They are not positions or claims that polite society is really equipped to engage with. They are so far outside the bounds of what is socially acceptable in 2015 that it is difficult to imagine many forums in which they would even be permitted to be aired. I'd go with something glib like "even Fox News would sack someone who publicly expressed those views," but even that seems insufficient. Truth be told, I have trouble thinking of any mainstream groups or organizations where someone who publicly espoused those views would not be ostracized.<br>
<br>
Except, apparently, orthodox sci-fi/fantasy fandom, in which Theodore Beale has sufficient clout within orthodox sci-fi/fantasy fandom to select 68% of the Hugo Award nominees.<br>
<br>
The question of how this happened is simple enough - the Hugo nomination process is fairly easy to game if you've got a bit of organization and followers willing to splash out a bit of cash. It only took about 250 people to stuff the ballot box to this effect - about 12.5% of the overall people who sent in nominations, though closer to 25% in some of the smaller categories.<br>
<br>
More significant is the question of what this means.<br>
<br>
To be frank, it means that traditional sci-fi/fantasy fandom does not have any legitimacy right now. Period. A community that can be this effectively controlled by someone who thinks black people are subhuman and who has called for acid attacks on feminists is not one whose awards have any sort of cultural validity. That sort of thing doesn't happen to functional communities. And the fact that it has just happened to the oldest and most venerable award in the sci-fi/fantasy community makes it unambiguously clear that traditional sci-fi/fantasy fandom is not fit for purpose.</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/169560" target="_self">Charlemagne In Sweatpants</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6000864" target="_self">8:28 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

It was mostly boring stuff, but there was one book with a spaceship on it by an author I'd never heard of named Jack Vance.  So I picked it up!<br>
<br>
Page ten:  This is so weird!  What the hell is going on with the writing?<br>
<br>
Page fifty:  The main character just had a long and insanely convoluted argument with an innkeeper about wine quality.  What the fuck is this and where are the goddamn spaceships?<br>
<br>
Page Two Hundred:  OH MY DEAR LORD I NEED ALL OF THIS.<br>

This book made me chuckle because it poked the "black lesbian in a wheelchair" thing right in the EYE (certain people use that to mock PC/SJW ideas, as though black lesbians in wheelchairs don't exist--which is SO DUMB IT MAKES ME WANT TO EXPLODE. Of course, those people don't know any, but uh ... yeah). Anyway, this is a super fun book with great ideas, and I'm sad it didn't manage to take over the world. Guess the Diversity Mafia was snoozin' that day! But what do I know; I also happen to think that N. K. Jemisin has written some of the most imaginative and fun fantasy that I've read in years. :D<br>

		<a name="6001069"></a><div class="comments">Tamora Pierce's YA fantasy includes a variety of sexualities and gender expressions (including, in the Beka Cooper books, a trans woman, which I definitely hadn't seen in YA fantasy before), in a calm and age-appropriate fashion.<br>
<br>
The Living Circle books feature more LGBT characters (and main characters) than Tortall (especially early Tortall when publishers were more strict about YA and sex), but she presents a really healthy attitude towards sexuality overall - basically that sex is good, coercion is bad, you should be careful with other people's feelings but you dont have to get married about it, and healthy relationships are mutually supportive but can look a lot of different ways. Her straight adolescent  characters often look to gay adult couples they admire for relationship models. It's just so, so healthy and she so, so calm about it ... no freaking out, no beating you over the head with a moral lesson. Levelheaded adults explain thoughtfully when adolescents have sexuality questions.<br>
<br>
I mean, you can give it to your 12-year-old with the confidence that he or she will come away with healthy attitudes towards sex without having read anything graphic or titillating or age inappropriate. And that they will see a diversity of races and sexualities represented.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001069" target="_self">10:59 PM</a>  on April 7, 2015

Or bisexual and that kind of asexual that really is only into one single person ever, but like, SUPER into that person, and everyone else is kind of meh. Also it is SO FUN and totally worth reading, and its sequel is like 10x trashier but in the best way possible, like a SHELTERED QUEER TEENS TAKE ON THE WORLD, BEFRIEND ROCKSTARS, SAVE PEOPLE kind of thing.<br>

I really like gay parents/family members just being, you know, around, especially since so many stories default to doing representation by giving everyone The One Gay Friend (and the person they get together with at the last second). I mostly picked up this trilogy because it's on Scribd and the audiobooks are narrated by Kristine Hvam, and I like her voice well enough to read some just-okay-kinda-boring books that she happens to narrate, and I definitely wouldn't tell people who aren't usually into romance-heavy YA fantasy stuff to read them, but Verlaine and her dads are pretty wonderful.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/84904" target="_self">NoraReed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001249" target="_self">6:56 AM</a>  on April 8, 2015

The fact that the current Sad Puppy slate is not, in fact, entirely made up of white straight conservative men, does not seem to alter their stated perception. The fact that the Sad Puppies flat-out state that’s not what the campaign is about doesn’t alter this perception either: they’re accused of lying about their true motives.</blockquote>

		<a name="6001439"></a><div class="comments"><i>The Hugos have always been fairly unrepresentative, but this is a problem with awards of this kind in general. They are in many ways a byproduct of the largely unquestioned consensus of the 20th century that a given work is "best" having been approved by a selection of tastemakers.</i><br>
<br>
(Haven't been posting because I was at the Eastercon and then traveling back. Suffice to say there was much reaction there. Seeing cstross's reaction in realtime and person, forex.) <br>
<br>
Well, the Hugos have tried to be open, which is exactly why the SPs were able to basically take the entire slate. Nominations are actually not that hard. Fundamentally, nominations are fifth-past-the-post, but unless you were willing to join the Worldcon, you had no voice in the Hugos.<br>
<br>
This was by design. The Hugos are *not* the award of all SF. They are the awards of WSFS, and the members of WSFS are the members, both supporting and attending, of the Worldcons. That's it. About half the "fix the Hugo" proposals miss this point -- it's a WSFS award, and anything that involves non-members of WSFS means the proposal is a non-starter and has to be. If you want to create the award that attempts to represent all fandom, I wish you all the best, but the Hugo Award is *not* that award. <br>
<br>
Indeed, there are a lot of things forgotten.<br>
<br>
1) This is not a problem with the Hugo Voting process. The last time Vox Day got onto the ballot, he came in dead last in the actual voting. This is a problem in the Hugo Nomination process, which has always been vulnerable to a slate nomination, and depended on social mores against slate nominations to prevent it. When a group who didn't care about that came along, the ease of a slate to overwhelm made the results very clear. <br>
<br>
2) The Hugos are a product of WSFS and WSFS alone. There are other awards, all claiming things like Best Novel and Best Dramatic Presentation, awards in different ways by different groups. The most congruent is probably SFWA's Nebulas, but they don't have the Fan Awards (SWFA is a professional writing association and thus explicitly only awards works sold professionally.) Others are the BSFA (but limited to British works) and the Clarke. <br>
<br>
There's no One True Award. The Hugos and Nebulas are clearly Two of the Three Big Ones, just as the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes are two of the Three Big Ones in the Movie field, but everyone debates what #3 is, and it depends. <br>
<br>
3) There will be several dozen bad ideas to change the nominations. Thankfully, the business meeting regulars, by and large, will shoot them down quickly. There will be several ideas on changing the vote. All of them should be shot down, the vote itself isn't the problem. The best idea I've seen is Mike Scott's idea that expands the slate should certain thresholds be reached, which means that in the case of a slate nomination, while the slate does get nominated, the works that would have been pushed off the ballot remain on the ballot, so we see a 10-12 vote line, rather than 6. A number of smart people are running numbers on previous elections, where we know all the totals, to see if the threshold's that Mike has proposed are good ones, and his proposal has the advantage of *expanding* nominations.<br>
<br>
4) So far, this all appears to be legal. You know $5 SAIT, of course, but it's $40 SAIT for the Worldcon. If you pay your supporting membership, you get to nominate, as long as they properly joined either Loncon, Sasquon, or MidAmericon II (Before January 31st) they were eligible to nominate however they chose to do so.  Regardless of motivation, if they paid their own $40, they had the right. If you could prove that someone else paid that $40 and/or filled out that actual ballot, that would be different, but if you, a person, paid the money and filled out the ballot, it's a valid ballot. There are not *rules* against the SP slate. Someone put it correctly. The penalty for breaking the rules is disqualification, the penalty for breaking social norms isn't, it should be punishment via the vote process.<br>
<br>
5) And you have that power. It costs $40, SAIT. If, and only if, you are a member, Supporting or Attending, of Sasquaon, this year's Worldcon, you may vote on which, <b>if any</b>, of these nominees is valid. And one of those votes is No Award. If No Award wins, it means just that. If No Award wins Best Novel, then No Award for Best Novel would be made this year. <br>
<br>
6) This may not happen. They may win all the awards. The end results would be the diminishment of the Hugo Awards. I have no idea what would replace them, but something would. There's always a top award, and if the Hugos became obviously slate-ridden trolling, then something else would replace them. <br>
<br>
7) If you want to change the Hugo *process*, the supporting membership isn't going to be enough. You need to attend the business meeting, which needs you are going to need to be there, and if you don't follow the conventions of that body, you will have little success. There are people out there to help you. In particular, I would start with Mr. Kevin Standee (@KevinStandlee on twitter, <a href="http://kevin-standlee.livejournal.com">kevin_standlee</a> on LiveJournal) who is very familiar with the process, the history behind why the Constitution/Standing Rules are the way they are, how they got there, and is more than willing to help those new to the WSFS business meeting find their way. He can also introduce you to other regulars who are known to help craft amended to be both more likely to pass and more likely to not have really bad side effects when integrated with the existing constitutions. He's also probably about to see a change he's been pushing for a while (going from "ratify constitutional changes at next Worldcon to ratify at next two Worldcons) get blown out of the water as everyone screams OMG WE HAVE TO FIX THIS CAN'T BE SLOWER NO! which is a shame, because I think he's probably right about it. <br>
<br>
Apparently, they did fix the usual "See new business, kill it with OTC" problem by *finally* bringing back Postpone Indefinitely as a valid motion, which lets you actually bring it back later if you want to.  Objection to Consideration kills a motion completely and utterly without debate (but requires a supermajority to do so.) The idea behind OTC is right -- if you can't get 25% of the meeting onboard at the start, it's probably dead, but it gets interpreted as a hostile move. Postpone Indefinitely, with at least a chance of resurrection, is a softer way of shunting business that's not going to succeed to the side while getting on with stuff that will. <br>
<br>
8) If you don't think that old fans aren't as angry-hurt by this as you are, you're probably wrong. Indeed, they're probably more angry-hurt than you are, because they've invested a lot more in the Hugo process over the decades than you have. They are *very* angry and *very* hurt, just like you. Don't dismiss them because they're old pharts. The old pharts (admittedly, I'm probably now one of them) are very much on your side in this.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001439" target="_self">11:33 AM</a>  on April 8, 2015

In general, this is how much control authors have over the covers. <br>
<br>

<br>
Did you see it?<br>
<br>
Yep. That's it. Sometimes, better selling ones can get some changes of things they dislike, and if you're truly offended, a good publisher will work with you, but author's opinions on covers are generally ignored.<br>
<br>
As they should be, because, well, Authors are the folks who write stories and Publishers are the people who sell books, and we've seen what happens when we let one of them try to do the other ones job. We've seen what happens when Authors try to make covers, in most cases, they range from really bad to OMG bad to WTF?<br>
<br>
So, I never blame the author for the cover in traditional publishing, because they almost never get a say in it other than the exact spelling of their name -- and sometimes, the publishers will strongly encourage them to change that!<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001451" target="_self">11:43 AM</a>  on April 8, 2015

But yes, you have to be there, which means you have to have an attending membership. This is the one vote (well, stack of votes) that you can't do with a supporting membership.

		<a name="6001468"></a><div class="comments">Following on from eriko's excellent comment, I would add also that the Puppies don't care about the Hugos or fandom other than as a cheap practise ground for their kulturwars. This was a political move done by radicals as part of a much wider war they are attempting to wage to change American culture and politics to something that I certainly have no problems calling fascist. Their aim is twofold: to put their (perceived) enemies on the defense and hurt and frighten them with their power to blatantly manipulate the Hugos and to use the Hugos as a propaganda tool for their broader war. They don't really care if the Hugos or fandom is destroyed in the process because the ringleaders don't really care about this. <br>
<br>
Anything done to fight this needs to keep this reality in minds, needs to take into account both the fanaticism and organisation behind the Puppies: that's their strength. <br>
<br>
Our own strengths are perhaps less apparant because, as eriko said, anybody with $40 can nominate and if you have an organisation with several hundred members willing to stump up that $40 it's now been proven you can vote in a slate. <br>
<br>
Counter slating won't work because we don't have this sort of lockstep organisation and because it goes directly against the spirit of the Hugos, but what's more, it's fighting the Puppies on their own terms and accepts that their view of the Hugos, as nothing more than a political propaganda tool, is right. <br>
<br>
Limiting the voting pool won't work because as any look at a broader political context shows, it's always those the Puppies hate and fear the most: people of colour, women, other vulnerable groups, who lose out when voting is restricted, while rightwing parties always benefit from restricted turnouts as their cadres are usually more disciplined. <br>
<br>
The better option therefore is to expand the voting pool, but not in a way that makes it useless. Having an unrestricted vote is worthless as that makes the Hugos even more vulnerable to slate flooding cf. the various 4chan manipulated opionion polls we've seen. The more people we have invested in fandom, in the Hugos, the less easy it is to push through a slate, the more costly it becomes.<br>
<br>
I also like Mike Scott's idea of expanding nomination lists when slate voting is present, as the greatest damage done is the pushing out of deserving candidates by the slate during the nomination press, not so much the final voting. <br>
<br>
Whatever we do we should be aware that any changes take time: don't forget it cost the Puppies several years of organised campaigning and manipulation to get to this point and our counter measures won't be in place in a year either, even without taking into account the deliberate slow pace of rule changing eriko wrote about.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the best thing you can do is to become a supporting member of this year's Worldcon if you're not already: you then get to vote in this year's Hugos and next year nominations. <br>
<br>
If you do so, vote and consider the non-slate candidates in the usual matter, on merit, then no award the Puppies. <br>
<br>
So frex, in the novel category, rate Ancillary Sword and The Goblin Queen according to your preference, then follow by No Award, then OMIT all Puppy candidates. Note: this is a point people always get confused about, but the only way to make sure a candidate can't use your vote to win is by leaving them off. Ranking below no award still leaves them with a chance, as no award is treated like any other choice  and can be eliminated, after which your next choic is considered.

<br>
Part of me disagrees. <br>
<br>
I feel that this year's awards are fundamentally compromised, and that maybe a better solution is this.<br>
<br>
Vote No Award on *everything*. <br>
<br>
Why? Because if we honestly No Award every award, then, well, no awards are given in 2015. We now have a mechanism in place to fix them -- the Retro Hugos. Normally, we have to wait some large number of years (50, IIRC) to do that, but the other critera is that we only do Retro Hugo's when there were no Hugo's awarded.<br>
<br>
So, if we No-Award this year, and change the constitution a bit, we could run the 2015 Retro Hugos in 2017. <br>
<br>
It's not a perfect answer -- but it could be a better answer than most.  It'll be an award for 2015. It'll let everyone have a fair shot again. It won't affect the next years award like an all-kill and extend eligibility would. <br>
<br>
There's no good answer, but maybe that's the least bad. But I'm personally not willing to vote for the few non S/RP nominees, because they're not running against the works they should be running against. They're basically getting a free ride if I do that. It's not fair to them or to the works that were shoved off by the slate. <br>
<br>
So, kill them all, with no awards given at all, then we get a redo option via the Retro-Hugo mechanism, which is already in place. The only thing we can't fix is the Campbell, everyone on this year's slate loses a year of eligibility. <br>
<br>
(Note: Part of me thinks this is a good idea. I'm not sure it is.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001489" target="_self">12:14 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

A good point actually. The counter argument would be that if fandom collectively no awards the puppies but rewards non-puppies, the incentive to allow yourself on the puppy slate is that much less. <br>
<br>
Because that's what needs doing as well, making it very clear to those on the puppy slate that their tacit approval of being on the slate has consequences. The John C. Wrights won't care, but their peons will.<br>

<br>
I think this is the kind of reactionary shit that people say when they're angry, but it has no basis in reality. Look, really look, at Torgensens' blog, or Correia's, or a ton of other people who are supporting Sad Puppies. They are full of long, long words about how much SF and the fandom community matters to them. They talk about <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/22/my-fanifesto/">why they are fans</a> - the <a href="http://karyenglish.com/2015/02/on-discovering-sff-and-becoming-a-fan/">things they loved</a> that made them fans, the<a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/2015/02/a-fan-manifesto/"> first SF books they read that changed their lives.</a> Torgensen's much-mocked <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/sad-puppies-3-the-unraveling-of-an-unreliable-field/">Nutty Nuggets analogy</a> is specifically to address what he sees as the upcoming stagnant semi-death of SF. <br>
<br>
And honestly, you don't get into this kind of war unless it's something you care about. Torgensen is a Chief Warrant Officer in the US Army who <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/07/sad-puppies-some-responses-to-the-fallout/">just got off deployment orders</a> and handled much of the Sad Puppies slate from his no doubt<em> copious</em> free time on active duty. <br>
<br>
They do care. They care a lot. You may feel their hearts are in the wrong place, and that's a totally valid thing to feel, but it's pretty obvious that this matters to them. Because if they wanted to just fight culture wars, there are lots of other places to do that. A lot of the Baen crowd is former military - we would happily take them with open arms on the veteran side of the house. Conservatives are hurting for good bloggers who know how to write. They could do very well other places. They are in this fight because it matters to them, because for better or worse, they are fans, and fandom is their home.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001527" target="_self">12:37 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

<br>
This is the "Human Shield" argument, I think. And I'm....not sure if I fully buy into it, but I do get why some make the argument. I believe that a withdrawal at this stage would not result in a work advancing (we'd drop to 4+No Award on the final ballot) and I could also see the idea of "I had no idea this would happen, it did, I'm withdrawing now" being a good way to earn a lot of reputation in fandom, but I also have a pretty good idea of the giddy feeling those people had when they got the call asking if they accepted the nomination. <br>
<br>
I'm also really torn about "punishing" BDP-L and BDP-S, which I suspect weren't much affected. <i>Interstellar</i> and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> were almost certainly going to be on the ballot. <br>
<br>
The reason I'm favoring a global kill No Award is that it might (stress that might) give us a do- over chance. That's really the only point in its favor. If it's clear that that do-over wouldn't occur, then we're probably adding a little more harm ontop of the rest of the harm.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001533" target="_self">12:41 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

<br>
No, it's a screed complaining and whining that a Golden Age of Manly Man SF that never existed doesn't exist anymore and that <i>real</i> SF doesn't deal with race or gender or homophobia or any other social issues. We've already explained this to you; repeating yet again that it's really about something else isn't going to make it true.<br>
<br>
There is no coming 'stagnant semi-death' of SF. There is an <i>opening up</i> of the genre to more diverse voices that discuss more diverse things and visions of (alternate) futures, which is precisely what SF has always been.<br>
<br>
<i>Because if they wanted to just fight culture wars, there are lots of other places to do that</i><br>
<br>
Fighting a culture war is <i>exactly</i> what they are doing; they are sad in their man-parts because people are writing about people who don't have man-parts or their man-parts are a different colour. These people are no different in any way from the people freaking out about Kirk and Uhura kissing.<br>
<br>
<i> You may feel their hearts are in the wrong place, and that's a totally valid thing to feel, but it's pretty obvious that this matters to them.</i><br>
<br>
That's because their hearts <i>are</i> in the wrong place. Using 'it really matters to them' is a staggeringly useless and stupid metric to use--it <i>really matters</i> to a lot of people that I not be allowed to get married or adopt children; it <i>really matters</i> to a lot of people that women not be allowed to control their own bodies; it <i>really matters</i> to a lot of people to shoot all the Christians; it <i>really matters</i> to a lot of people that nobody with money should ever be held to account or pay their fair share; I could go on.<br>
<br>
Who gives any fucks how much it matters to them? They are wrong and they are advocating for the silencing of voices that have spent most of history being silenced, and are only now finding free expression. They are saying that people like me <i>don't get to see people like me in books</i>, because that's somehow antithetical to the genre. What they care about is wrong, no matter how <i>much</i> they care about it.<br>
<br>

<br>
<em> Of course, one way to fight a political party is with a rival political party. Many people expect rival slates to appear next year, and for the Hugos to forever be a battle of slates, which means that the Hugos will be a battle of ideologies rather than a referendum on the quality of fiction.<br>
<br>
This is not a simple problem to fix. Strategic voting — modifying your vote based on what you know or believe about the votes of others — is a powerful strategy, and probably a dominant one. But there are voting systems that minimize the effects of slate voting.<br>
<br>
But remember, no election system is perfect, and choosing one is an exercise in trading off among various problems. It’s may be easy to reconfigure an election system to reduce the effects of a current set of abuses, but it’s much harder to design an election system that is immune from future abuses. Any changes should be examined carefully before being implemented. </em><br>
<br>
I agree with the unintended consequences part, but I think that Schneier's pessimism about using government (or organization in this case) to fix things encourages passivity. One the same problems I had with his book Liars and Outliars actually.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/15003" target="_self">zabuni</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001546" target="_self">12:51 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

<br>
In the case of Torgensen or Correia, if they really cared about the fannish community, they would not have broken one of the strongest mores in the community, which is ONE DOES NOT BLOCK VOTE A SLATE ONTO THE HUGO BALLOT. The community has known for years that it would be easy to block-vote a slate on to the ballot, and we avoided that problem by saying "If you truly love fandom and want to be a part of it, you won't do that." <br>
<br>
That's why everyone is so angry here, corb. They took the "do not piss on the grass" sign and invited hundred to do so, and now everybody is very angry at the giant puddle of piss that has resulted. <br>
<br>
I give credit to Correia pulling his nomination -- he didn't want to do this as a self-promotion effort, and his accepting the nomination would be seen as his doing so -- but that's all I'm willing to give him credit for. They wanted a slate.<br>
<br>
But the real harm was VD's Rabid Puppies slate, which is, in fact, the slate that was largely elected.

The SP response would be that people have been pissing on the grass for a long time, and ignoring it, and they just made it public, in a way that could not be ignored.<br>

		<a name="6001618"></a><div class="comments">Corb: Correira and Torgensen at this stage are at best usefull idiots, allowing themselves to be used in an attempt to destroy the Hugos out of spite because they're thoroughly mediocre, not nearly as commercially succesful as they think they are writers who burn red hot at the thought of John Scalzi both outselling them and winning Hugos, not understanding why this is. <br>
<br>
If they were real fans, they wouldn't have pulled this stunt. And Correira doesn't get a pass just for withdrawing. That only shows he's marginally brighter than Torgensen and can spot a shitstorm coming his way. <br>
<br>
<cite>Torgensen's much-mocked Nutty Nuggets analogy is specifically to address what he sees as the upcoming stagnant semi-death of SF</cite><br>
<br>
Torgensen is almost exactly my age, forty years old, which means he's at least ten years younger than the New Wave is: the sort of science fiction he supposedly wants to see hasn't been published in his lifetime, if ever. Looked at objectively, you could argue that even the sort of SF John Campbell published is too leftwing for him, too much concerned with politics and social justice. He isn't harkening to a golden age, he's a radical who wants to alter what science fiction is retroactively by imposing his limited taste on the entire genre. <br>
<br>
It's not about being a conservative or rightwinger, it's about having this massive entitlement complex that Torgensen suffers from that makes him think the genre should revolve around him and his view of science fiction. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile as a counter example there's Gene Wolfe, arch-conservative Catholic with a shelf full of Hugo and Nebula awards won on merit and David Weber, whose Honor Harrington series for all its early liberal baiting and occassional loony rightwing tropes still managed to be a NYT bestselling series and much loved by some of the same people who Torgensen is convinced are keeping good rightwingers down, including yours truly. Torgensen and Correira and their followers could and should've followed their example and let their work be judged on its own merits, but instead they choose victim mode and wanted everything handed on a platter to them. <br>

Schneier said that it isn't hard to see it in votes, and it would be interesting if a historical analysis of ballots were done, but I don't know if there's any way that can be done.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001624" target="_self">1:39 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6001627"></a><div class="comments"><i>eriko, I am curious as to whether you think my preferences for preventing slate voting in the nominations (limit the number of nominations a single person can make in a given category, possibly even to one, and/or introduce a multi-stage nomination process with at least one long list before the short list is selected) are decent ideas, or ones that would do more harm than good.<br>
</i><br>
<br>
That can limit the effect -- a slate can only take as many slots as they can nominate. I know there's the 4-6 proposal, limiting nominations to 4 and increasing the slots to 6, that's currently in flight. <br>
<br>
But a slate can still steal slots from others who aren't running on an actively campaigned slate. So, while it mitigates the damage, it doesn't eliminate it. Personally, I think a 1-5 or 2-6 is a better number there -- a combination of limiting the percentage of the final ballot you can nominate plus increasing the number of nominators would work to reduce the effectiveness of slates. <br>
<br>
I really like Mike Scott's proposal, which has no fixed number on the final ballot, but instead takes the total number of nominations for a category, subtracts the number of nominations from the #1 nominee in that category, and then any contender who has 10% of the remaining total also appears on the ballot. This has the effect of expanding the ballot, which removes the primary harm here -- the slate is nominated, but the works that would have been pushed off are nominated as well. From what we can currently tell, the percentage he's selected is correct, but we really need to see the full nomination numbers for this year, and we won't until after the final awards are made, and even then, we're working on one datapoint. <br>
<br>
But I'd rather error in favor of too many than too few.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001627" target="_self">1:41 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6001650"></a><div class="comments">Multistage nominations can also limit slates, as long as you limit the number of nominations (so you're nominating say 3 of 10.) Slates can easily take over if you allow the number of nominations you make to equal the number of slots on the final ballot. In the case of the multistage (say the first is a 15/15, then the second is a 5 of those 15), you just pack the 15, then pick the 5 you really want.<br>
<br>
But if there's 15 and you can only pick 3, then there's 12 slots you don't control. Pack the three slots you do, and everyone hates them, and they can move 5 of the other 12 to the final ballot.<br>
<br>
Another factor of multistage is cost -- you need to do an open nomination phase, validate entries, and confirm that everyone who reaches the next 15 is willing to continue. Then, you have to run that ballot, select the top five, and then only run the final ballot. This costs a bit of actual money and a fair amount of people time, and Worldcons are usually really not wealthy in either of those and downright poor in the latter. <br>
<br>
Most people would just say "run the 15 as a STV vote and call it done," and I'd be sympathetic to that. Heck, if you proposed 5 nomination leading to a 15 slot ballot, I'd be good -- the chief objection would be "I can't read that many in time!"<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001650" target="_self">1:51 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6001674"></a><div class="comments">My experience as a fan (First Worldcon: Confederation in 1986) is this. The only time before this that I know of direct campaigning for a Hugo was when the Scientologists were campaigning for L. Ron Hubbard's 10 volume whatever thing. Didn't work. Indeed, the fact that they tried was very much remarked on as a thing that Was Not Done. <br>
<br>
No author has *ever* said to me directly "Please nominate/vote for me." A number of them will make an annual post in various fora (depending on the year) of "These are the works I created last year" and I think *one* post of that sort is perfectly legitimate and helps solve the problem of "Well, you threw away that nominating vote, because that work came out a year before you thought it did and it's not eligible." And, yes, this has been a problem, esp. for works published late in a year, when many people then pick up late in the next year. <sup>*</sup><br>
<br>
I have seen various people, including authors, in the course of a review, claim that they feel work X was "Hugo Worthy." Well, it's a review, that's an opinion, they are welcome to make that claim. I would *hope* nobody is nominating and voting based solely on a review, but if they are, that's the closest to a slate I've ever seen before this year, but be clear, I think calling something Hugo Worthy in the context of review is fine. <br>
<br>
So, that's my position.<br>
<br>
* And that's enough of a problem that the WSFS Business Meeting can actually extend eligibility of works that it feels were harmed in eligibly by being published very late in the year by a small press, so that they didn't get much exposure until after the nomination process was complete. Generally, this isn't a controversial motion, either. I'm unaware of any work that's later gone to make a ballot after an extension, but hey I can be wrong. In general, the ur-rule of nominations is "we want everyone to have one fair shot at the ballot" and if timing means you missed a fair shot at your year, WSFS will generally give you a shot at it the next year.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001674" target="_self">2:05 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6001702"></a><div class="comments"><i>My impression is that you need all the ballots, not just a snapshot of how many nominations any given work received.</i><br>
<br>
Nope -- blocks will show up quite dramatically as a cluster of five (in this case) works with almost identical counts, and in the smaller categories, they'll also have many more votes. Looking at the number-to-nominate this year, it's quite clear that's something's up. These are minimum numbers to nominate for this year and last -- that is, the last person on the ballot had that many nominations. The last number is the maximum nominations last year -- basically, the #1 slot in that category, last year. <pre>Cat.   '15 '14min '14max
Novel  256  98    368
Nvlla  145  86    143
Nvtte  165  69    118
Short  151  43/38 79
BRW    206  52    89</pre>

BRW is Best Related Work. The dual number in Short Story -- 38 was the 5th place total, but it didn't qualify because it didn't get 5% of the total nominations, so last year, there were only 4 on the ballot, and #4 had 43. <br>
<br>
Look at the difference. Literally an order of magnitude higher minimum this year.  Actual nominations were up as well, by about 200-300, depending, and this is after one of the largest Worldcons we've ever had, where you would expect nominations to be unusually high, so going higher than that is pretty stunning as well. But the really damning number is that, except in Novel, the *minimum* to get a nomination in a category this year is higher than *anybody* got in that category last year.<br>
<br>
In short, just from the numbers we have now, it's very clear that about 200-250 people joined the nomination population and nominated almost identically. If they hadn't block voted, the minimum to nominate wouldn't have jumped up by as many as it had.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001702" target="_self">2:25 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

Yes, by doing a full analysis on the ballots from previous years, you could see if an unlikely number of ballots were nominating the same "group" of works.<br>
<br>
But honestly, just from the raw numbers (and I checked with a few from earlier years, they're similar), it seems very doubtful indeed.  If there was some kind of cabal secretly bloc voting, it would have had to be a pretty tiny number of people.

1. Are we talking about Metafilter here, or about the science fiction community in general? I'd be interested to see some posts by folks trying to defend the slate.<br>
<br>
2. <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/04/04/a-note-about-the-hugo-nominations-this-year/">John Scalzi</a> is also backing a merit based approach with aggressive "no award"ing, which doesn't seem unreasonable. If you want to bring additional content into it, it doesn't seem unreasonable to call on the slated authors to account for why they wanted to be on the slate. (As has been noted multiple times, Torgersen's rationale for assembling it in the first place is clear, so I suppose folks could also no award everyone as a slap in his face.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001739" target="_self">2:49 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6001741"></a><div class="comments">It's obvious from the last few years that if anybody was running a block, they've been doing a really bad job. If there's a block, you're going to see those works jumping onto the ballot and a big numerical break between them and the rest, or the block is so small that it really doesn't have an effect. Yes, you got your parents to nominate, but those three votes, while a block, did not get you onto the ballot. <br>
<br>
There's a real reason Sasquan ran <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/coalescent/17038229312/">this slide</a> during the announcement. "Hey, look at this unusual numbers." I was at the Eastercon, which is a UK convention, which means it has a bar, and this one had a rather nice real ale bar, so I'm not going to say that everyone involved was perfectly awake or sober, but a quick back of the random sheet of A4 calculation put the chances of these numbers as being so close to zero that we had to be careful not to drop zeros when expressing it. <br>
<br>
If anyone want to present statistically significant proof that previously elections had significant blocks that clearly changed the nomination results, they are welcome to do so. So far, no person has, so, well, I'm ignoring them. Many can claim so without presenting evidence. I claim they are wrong by the exact same standard of evidence. When they provide a better proof, I will provide a better refutation -- but not before.

		<a name="6001783"></a><div class="comments">I'm pretty sure the reason Day and Torgersen are so insistent that there was some kind of SJW voting bloc conspiracy is that, like the Gators they formed common cause with, on some level they can't or won't believe that women, people of color, and LGBT people are genuine fans of their beloved genre. It can't be that other fans <em>genuinely</em> think that this novel concerning "social justice" is also a fine entry into the science fiction canon--it must be some plot to take something away from them.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure, chicken-and-egg like, if their very narrow idea of what constitutes "acceptable" science fiction (as laid out in Torgersen's much-quoted blog post) stems from looking for non-threatening pablum or if it's the love of non-threatening pablum that feeds this fear of the other, but they certainly seem to go hand in hand. One of Mefi's own wrote an excellent <a href="http://barrl.net/?p=2553">blog post</a> about how what Gators seem to be striving for is a kind of stagnation, not for gaming to grow and evolve and comment upon itself the way art has always done.

In this case though he's wrong: noble, but wrong. This is a political act that needs a political response, you can't go around still pretending that nothing has happened. You need to send a strong, clear message to the Kary Englishes and other fellow travellers that being part of a Puppy slate may get you nominated, but won't win you awards, that being part of this attempt to destroy the Hugos and fandom will only boomerang back on you. <br>

No one who is part of a slate is getting my vote.<br>

First and foremost, I am voting *against* the very idea of a Hugo nomination slate.<br>

After that, I will vote *for* whoever is left.<br>

I consider anyone who got in on a slate, whatever their reasoning, motivation, or writing quality, not to have gotten in based on the merits of their writing.  I do not believe that the majority of people who nominated them read the works in question.<br>
<br>
They weren't "cheating"?  Don't care.  It's not cheating for me to leave them off the award ballot.  Maybe their writing is awesome?  Don't care.  I'll take that into account when they get in because of the awesomeness of their writing and not because they were on a slate.<br>

Foster, film critic, director of Dragon*Con, and the widower of SF writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugie_Foster">Eugie Foster</a>, who passed away from cancer last year: <blockquote>The Hugo Award nominations were revealed yesterday and they brought some sadness with them as Eugie wasn’t nominated. Not all that much sadness, as I’m pretty much sad all the time, so this was a very minor prick. And not that disappointing as her chances weren’t great (she’d only been nominated once before). But this was her best chance (since her previous nomination). Her story, When It Ends, He Catches Her, was nominated for a Nebula Award, and awards can affect awards—sort of like the Golden Globes affecting the Oscars. Though the metaphor ends there as The Nebulas are more like the Oscars; The Hugos would be The People’s Choice Awards.<br>

It’s just a bit more depressing because any chance she did have was taken away by The Sad Puppies. </blockquote>Good job, puppies.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001932" target="_self">4:32 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

<blockquote>I’ve repeatedly seen Brad Torgerson and Ken Burnside (a nominee but not an organizer) refer to the ballot as a “more inclusive” and “more diverse” ballot than recent years have offered. That…is not what inclusive means. It’s definitely not what diverse means. This ballot features one man in three out of five novella slots and six in total, one publisher in nine slots, and an overwhelming majority of white straight men. Even if you think all this is appropriate and excellent, you cannot call it inclusive or diverse without assaulting the English language. Let’s go to the dictionary! Inclusive: <em>including a great deal, or including everything concerned; comprehensive! Diverse: of varying kinds, multiform, including representatives from more than one social, cultural, or economic group, especially members of ethnic or religious minority groups</em>!<br>
<br>
I suppose you could say “this list is more inclusive of myself and my friends, and more diverse in that myself and my friends are on it when we were not before” but that’s not what any of it actually means. It’s grotesque to defend oneself by claiming inclusivity and diversity when that is exactly what the unaltered ballots of recent years, the ones they hate so much, have given us.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
I suspect it’s because they know inclusivity and diversity are considered positive attributes by most people. Exclusivity and uniformity don’t sell. Despite their conviction that they are the persecuted majority, they know that no one wants to hear: <em>we made a club so that we could be sure only people we approved politically and personally would be nominated</em>. No one wants to hear: <em>isn’t it nice how we’ve scrubbed the ballot of all those undesirables? Now it’s just us</em>! What they did is unpalatable, and they know it. But now that they’ve gotten what they want, they need people to be happy about it in order for the award to have any meaning, and so they’ve grabbed the language of the enemy to praise themselves. Only it doesn’t work, because words have meanings. It’s a pretty classic conservative technique (see the fact that Social Justice Warrior now means a bad person), but it’s depressing–or perhaps hilarious–to see it used by individuals because they can’t face the consequences of what they’ve done. You guys spent ages telling us diversity was bullshit and inclusivity was a creeping evil. Why are you now telling us, with a sneer and a smirk, that you are their champions? What is wrong with you? It’s all so unfathomably dishonest and intellectually bankrupt I have a hard time believing any of these people put together a coherent novel at any point.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/181391" target="_self">sukeban</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6001984" target="_self">4:56 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

To be fair, apparently some of the individuals on the Puppies slate have been <a href="http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/please-stop-with-the-death-threats-and-the-hate-mail/">getting death threats</a>.  Unless this is the #GG folks running a false flag operation (which I don't put past them, but it seems unlikely), this is Bad Behavior.<br>
<br>
I suspect that some people agreed to be on the Sad Puppies slate, and then were horrified to realize that meant they'd be on the Rabid Puppies slate, and thus tarnished by associated with Beale.  Who is, one must note, <i>much</i> worse than Torgersen.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the purposes for which the slate was assembled, it's a waste of time claiming it's all misogynist or all racist, or all for spite, or because of fear that the field is no longer representative of them (although it never really was).  It's everything, and it was assembled in a slap-dash way by people who didn't go out and read everything, but collected from a random list of recommendations.  Many of those people making recommendations likely had no idea of the political affiliations or ethnic background of the writers (and perhaps they did know and didn't care).  <br>
<br>
I'm less sure of BT's desires, but VD and the #GG crowd are certainly in this to "strike back at SJWs", which means a subset of people, as they see it.  They don't care if some women and some POC and some LGBT folks publish or show up as characters in SF, so long as those people don't outshine the white/male writers and characters who are naturally most important.  They want to punish the women &amp; POC who they see as trouble-makers, shit-stirrers, people who <i>complain</i> about the field and make other people uncomfortable about their default white-male view of the future (or the past).  <br>
<br>
It's okay to be a female gamer: but don't be Anita Sarkeesian.  It's okay to be a black female writer: but don't be Tempest Bradford or N. K. Jemisin.  Keep your head down, play the game, don't demand anything, don't challenge anyone.  We'll let you have some moderate success, so long as you don't threaten our natural, god-given dominance.<br>

<br>
Well, Correia <a href="http://monsterhunternation.com/2014/04/24/an-explanation-about-the-hugo-awards-controversy/">described</a> Sad Puppies 2 as being about getting "some right wingers" on the ballot in order to cause a perceived clique of left-wingers to flip out. In contrast, Correia's <a href="http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/04/06/a-letter-to-the-smofs-moderates-and-fence-sitters-from-the-author-who-started-sad-puppies/">description</a> of Sad Puppies 3, post-Hugo voting, seems watered-down beyond all recognition. It's ostensibly about "get[ting] talented, worthy, deserving authors who would normally never have a chance nominated for the supposedly prestigious Hugo awards", but is laced with us/them rhetoric without laying out an "us" or "them". ("Them" is the left, but the authors on the list are touted as crossing the political spectrum, so "us" is hard to construe as just the political right.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, but I'm not certain that anyone linked Torgersen's explanation, so here it is: <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/why-sad-puppies-3-is-going-to-destroy-science-fiction/">Why SAD PUPPIES 3 Is Going To Destroy Science Fiction.</a> His description isn't particularly political, it's just incoherent. The big complaint is that the Hugo awards voters are a marginal fraction of the new and expanding demographic of science fiction fans, and should be more reflective of mass market tastes. <i>At the same time</i> the one pull quote that I've seen over &amp; over again from this article is "SAD PUPPIES simply holds its collective hand out — standing athwart 'fandom' history — and yells, 'Stop!'"<br>
<br>
These are contradictory ends, to say the least. Not having any insight exactly as to how they decided what novels went on the slate and what didn't, it mostly seems like Brad Torgersen wanted more nominees that Brad Torgersen liked, and that he might have benefited from the puppies generally being about trolling the left.<br>
<br>
After all this, I think the puppies are nothing. Torgersen hitched his star to something a lot more distasteful, and benefited from reactionaries on the right.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6002105" target="_self">5:56 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6002195"></a><div class="comments"><em>Even if you think all this is appropriate and excellent, you cannot call it inclusive or diverse without assaulting the English language. Let’s go to the dictionary! Inclusive: including a great deal, or including everything concerned; comprehensive! Diverse: of varying kinds, multiform, including representatives from more than one social, cultural, or economic group,</em><br>
<br>
Cat Valente is a good and often great writer, but she should really stick to fiction rather than making claims about the English language.<br>
<br>
Diverse has a dictionary definition that does not always align with its social-justice definition. That's fine, and it's totally okay to complain about that, without accusing people of abusing the English language simply because they don't adopt your definition.<br>
<br>
Even if the Sad Puppies slate were all-white-men (which it is, as noted above, very far from being) you could still have a diverse all-white-men slate, if they were, say, of different economic backgrounds, or different cultural identities, or different religions, and still meet that dictionary definition. It might not be as diverse as someone might like, or diverse in the 'right direction', but it would still be <em>diverse</em>. <br>
<br>
But this is a way a writer can make a nasty insult. They're not just<em> wrong</em>, they're <em>ignorant</em>! A potent insult indeed in our intelligence and geek focused nerd SF culture. And really, that says you're scraping the bottom if those are the insults you need to levy. If you're calling for straight talk, try giving some - say 'I don't like these people and I think they're jerks' all you want, but don't accuse them of not being literate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6002195" target="_self">7:06 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

		<a name="6002217"></a><div class="comments">How are we to judge writers, if not by the way they wield their words, with precision and integrity or... not so much?<br>
<br>
Let's take for example, Brad Torgersen, who <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/016194.html">wrote</a>: <em>As always, you have the option to set aside your rancor at Vox Day (who was not involved with SP3) and GamerGate, and read your packet.</em><br>
<br>
The word <em>rancor</em> is an interesting one, wouldn't you say?  Particularly considering the already well-discussed views of VD.  Rancor implies that one is irrationally angry, that one has some axe to grind, that one is holding on to a grudge.  Is this how people who object to VD would understand themselves?  <br>
<br>
Ostensibly, here, Torgersen is trying to talk with such people, to convince them to set aside their views and feelings about VD and to consider this year's Hugo ballet without taking the role of VD into account.  Generally, when you are trying to persuade someone it's beneficial to display that you understand their perspective.  So, why didn't Torgersen use a word such as <em>objections</em> rather than <em>rancor</em>?<br>
<br>
Might Torgersen have a difficulty time understanding why people are upset about VD?  Might he struggle to empathize with, to see from the perspective of those folks?  Or might he just be needling people by using the word <em>rancor</em>?<br>
<br>
And we haven't even tried to talk about the complexities of to what extent his claim that VD was not involved with SP3 is an honest and accurate one.  At a minimum, I think it's certain that Torgersen knew about the existence of VD's Rapid Puppies and choose not to publicly distance himself from VD and his complementary efforts.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73881" target="_self">overglow</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6002217" target="_self">7:25 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

Yes, but that is only one more than her friend and fellow podcaster <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/31/seanan-mcguire-hugo-awards-shortlist">Seanan McGuire received in one single Hugo year</a>- only a few years ago, the previous recordholder, until this year, when it is Wright. So if these kind of novel multiple nominations were some kind of egregious sin, you'd think they'd equally be a sin for McGuire as they supposedly are for Wright.<br>
<br>
And to be honest, I bet that's one of the points of the Sad Puppies putting Wright up so many times - because when McGuire got five Hugo noms, you didn't see a lot of complaining from the SJW side about how terrible it was that she was taking up so much space on the ballot. So they've done something similar, and lo, let the complaining begin, as Valente notes sarcastically "<em>That John C. Wright is, essentially, the greatest science fiction writer of all time</em>." Did she think that the five Hugo noms made McGuire similarly eligible for mockery as  'the greatest science fiction writer of all time'? No, that would be silly, McGuire is a <em>friend.</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6002221" target="_self">7:28 PM</a>  on April 8, 2015

And I know, asking for a polite tone from people who are being attacked has all kinds of issues and isn't always the right thing.  But in this case where he was making a serious effort as a very well respected by all sides voice in this community to honestly convince people that the entire worth of this award is at stake because of the misguided campaign being waged by the conservative groups here, it may be the way to go.  Dialing down the vitriol to really examine the history of the award and what it really means is valuable. He might even be able to get through to some people, I hope.<br>
<br>
He's also a good example of someone who has been criticized at times for the content of ASOIAF or the HBO show not exactly being the type of thing a modern fan of social justice wants to see, but he doesn't let the criticism of his work interfere with how he feels about social justice in general.  I think he's doing a really great job here.<br>

R. Martin. Excerpt: <blockquote>George RR Martin has waded into the “nasty, nasty fight” surrounding this year’s Hugo awards, laying out why he believes that a group of right-wing science fiction writers have “broken” the prestigious prize beyond repair.<br>
<br>
The shortlists for the long-running American genre awards, won in the past by names from Kurt Vonnegut to Ursula K Le Guin and voted for by fans, were announced this weekend to uproar in the science fiction community, after it emerged that the line-up corresponded closely with the slates of titles backed by certain conservative writers. The self-styled “Sad Puppies” campaigners had set out to combat what orchestrator and writer Brad Torgersen had criticised as the Hugos’ tendency to reward “literary” and “ideological” works. </blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6002720" target="_self">11:12 AM</a>  on April 9, 2015

<br>
1. It's often applied to intra-community discussions where outsiders are not the primary audience.<br>
<br>
2. Stereotype bias exists, and perfectly polite discussions and texts frequently get reframed as anti-something. I suspect some of this is going on when inclusive or minority-centric texts get interpreted as "fuck you" pieces. I don't think Jemisin rises to the level of Early Tepper or current Sulway on the "fuck you" front. Lord, Addison, Beukes, and Leckie are not even close.<br>
<br>
3. The internet is a megaphone for cranks, and the media has an obvious conflict bias. Politeness is ignored in the former, and gets you a column inch on the community page in the latter. (Worse is that "someone said something dumb on twitter" is apparently news these days.)

I'm also forced to note that this whole concern about "fuck-you" types of SF seem much more worried and strident when the issue is racism than when the issue is sexism.  People didn't lose their shit about James Tiptree, Joanna Russ, or Sherri Tepper* the way they're losing their shit about N. K. Jemisin and calls for increased diversity.  <br>

Basically, sexism is bad &amp; the response to pointing it out is bad enough; but the response to pointing out racism -- especially when combined with sexism -- is just a nightmare.  All the toxic sludge comes pouring to the surface, flooding everything. <br>

That is a really interesting disconnect. I wonder how much of it is a perceived tipping point. It's one thing for there to be a feminist book niche that's typically well-enough marked as such to be easily avoided; it's another thing altogether to being able to see the slippery slope to where straight white men aren't centered, the thing the SJWs consider a feature and the puppies consider the end of the world.<br>
<br>
(I don't mean to dispute that you're onto something about how disproportionate the response is -- I think you clearly are.)<br>

And there's an interesting contrast to what's going on in videogames and comics, where the shit-losing remains predominantly about sexism.

		<a name="6003116"></a><div class="comments">There are a number of people I deeply respect -- GRRM and Uber-SMOF Ben Yalow leap to mind -- that really dislike the "These are the things I created last year" posts. I disagree with them, because historically, we've had a real problem with people wasting nominations on works that were not eligible. Even better, we might even be able to bring back the category we had to kill as unworkable. <br>
<br>
The Hugos, as a class, are awards for works. There are three exceptions. Best Fan Writer, Best Fan Artist, and Best Pro Artist. The former two are body-of-work awards because fan writing and fan art tends to be in the very small and frequent scale, rather than the very large artworks that the Pro artists, or complete stories that the pro writers did. Note that this elides fanfic and slash, because there are legal complications with those. Note this is changing. Note I'm talking about the past. <br>
<br>
The original pro art award was Best Artwork. The problem? It was impossible to know when the art was created. Basically, nominating was impossible, and verification was a nightmare. So, wanting to recognize art, we went to Best Pro Artist, but then it turned into a lifetime body-of-work award, and it tends to go to one person until that person gets tired and declines. <br>
<br>
With the Internet, we might be able to redo this back to Best Artwork, because the artists can put up "These are my eligible works this year" posts, and that's what we want to recognize. But for that to work, we have to accept that they can put up a 'These are my eligible works for this year." post.<br>
<br>
I don't mind those. When you repeat them, when you start sending multiple emails, then it's canvassing and it's crossing a line, but one post, on your website, saying "These, and only these, are my eligible works this year" and if you're not interested "I will be declining nominations this year, please do not nominate me" are *perfectly* reasonable. <br>
<br>
And the definition is clear. One time. One website. "These are my eligible works." Ben and GRRM think that this crosses onto the slippery slope. I think this is the solid edge we can hold before the "For your consideration" nightmare. We (at least Ben and I) agree to disagree on this one. We both agree, however, that the SP3/RP slates are *way* beyond the pale, no matter if you agree with me or not on the "This is my eligible works" post being kosher or not.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003116" target="_self">3:50 PM</a>  on April 9, 2015

Yeah, the gulf between "Here's which of my recent works are Hugo-eligible", or even "Here's what I'm going to be voting for, I encourage you to check them out," and "Here is the slate that we will be pushing to get onto the ballot" is so huge that you couldn't get from one to the other in a human lifetime without some kind of FTL craft.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/117509" target="_self">kagredon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003135" target="_self">3:59 PM</a>  on April 9, 2015

<br>
Yeah, I'm really enjoying the thoughtful way he is approaching this.  Not sure I'm 100% on board with everything yet (as eriko notes, above, I am often at sea when it comes to knowing what works are eligible - I've sat down with Hugo or Aurora ballots and thought "Oh, I should nominate that - wait, what year did that come out?" an awful lot, so the eligible works lists are actually handy - it would be great to have that centralized somewhere/somehow so that individual creators and publishing houses didn't have to run the risk of campaigning or the appearance thereof, but then whoever compiles it runs a risk of inadvertently leaving something out and getting attacked).  <br>
<br>
What makes it very interesting to me is that Martin:<br>
<br>
-is a huge name;<br>
-is a straight white male;<br>
-has a large body of work, that covers the spectrum of SF&amp;F;<br>
-has never won a Hugo for best novel;<br>
-has been criticized - and not unjustly - for how his fantasy epic has approached women and violence towards them as well as the use of racial stereotyping/tropes;<br>
<br>
So he appears to me to be exactly the kind of author the SP folks would be rallying behind in some ways, but he's going to stand against them.  And not for reasons that might be dismissed as "SJW" (though he is fairly liberal in his politics), but because he thinks it is bad for the industry as a whole.  I'm interested to see the reaction he will get, because his opinion will carry weight in part because of his name, but also because of how he is approaching this.<br>
<br>
And I think the approach is very important - SF&amp;F fandom is interesting to me, because at the cons and other places, the creators are right alongside the fans.

<br>
But the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/">details</a> get hairy. For serialized work, the eligibility date is determined by the final entry. Printed publication date, if it exists (or copyright date otherwise) determines year of eligibility, trumping actual availability date. The work is eligible in its original year of publication, but if was published in a language other than English, it's eligible again for its year of publication it translation into English; likewise, if it was published outside the US, it's eligible again for the year of its first US publication.<br>
<br>
Unless you are SERIOUSLY Hugo-award inside-baseball (I didn't know most of the above until I just looked it up -- I just remembered that there were some complicated bits) it can be opaque whether a given work is eligible in a given year.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12683" target="_self">Zed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003227" target="_self">5:12 PM</a>  on April 9, 2015

There were no Sad Puppies when Larry Correia was nominated for the Campbell, when Brad Torgersen was nominated for the Campbell, when Torgersen was nominated for his first Hugo. (Subsequent noms, yes, may have resulted from Puppy campaigns). That was the traditional Hugo electorate putting you on the ballot... you, and a lot of other conservative writers, religious writers, white male writers, and purveyors of space opera, military SF, and Good Old Stuff.<br>
<br>
There was never any need for Sad Puppies to "take back" the Hugos. The feminists, minorities, literary cliques, and Social Justice Warriors never took them in the first place.

		<a name="6003525"></a><div class="comments">L correia has posted a very long response to GRRM's first posting, which explains (or is supposed to explain) the SPs backstory.  I'll let you google it.  But I think it's basically a lot like Sarah Hoyt's one referenced somewhere upthread.  I'm sure I'll take heat for unfairly precising it, but it seemed to me to be along the lines of "My first nomination and first few cons, people treated me like shit because I was a libertarian gunshop owner.  And even if me and Brad T. are big enough to withstand personal attacks on our political/personal/religious beliefs (unfair ones at that), there's a lot of less well-known writers who are scared because of the general left-leaning BS at cons.  I was like the fat kid at the high school dance.  We're all scared.  Well, we're fighting back." <br>
<br>
First, I've got to make clear that I find it appalling that anyone would threaten the health or safety of any writer or their family because of the fucking Hugos, much less for any other reason.  So, I'm on board to that extent.  But the rest of the Hoyt/Correia  narrative doesn't actually jibe with the rhetoric floating around.  OK, you're fighting back against those evil SJW prom queens and kings who mocked your ugly tux at the dance.  And those mean lefty editors and writers made you scared that you wouldn't get work.  Got it.  <br>
<br>
But exactly how does that square with "Vote for John Wright's 3 different novellas, because he's just that damn good."  And "it's not about the politics/prom trauma, it's about quality of work!  And misleading cover illos with exploding spaceships that aren't really books about exploding spaceships!"  It's like bad teen drama.  The emotional tug of abused sensitive souls (or sensitive souls who feel they've been abused) gets conflated with the perils of trying to make a living as a genre writer, and feeling as though your work is devalued because of who you are (as though that hadn't happened for years to writers who aren't straight white men, but I digress).  <br>
<br>
And I can say honestly in my case that it doesn't really matter to me (except in the broadest 'oh, that must have been a bummer' sense) how you were treated in high school, and I really don't care much about what your politics are, but if I don't like your writing, I'm not interested in reading your books.  OK, maybe there's a little bit of me that is more inclined than not to ignore yet another book demonstrating the innate superiority and heroism of white guys with big guns or bigger swords, but I think I can write that off as personal taste by this point in my life. And if someone seems to be a big enough shit and a shit writer to boot, why should I bother wasting my time?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/221603" target="_self">my dog is named clem</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003525" target="_self">9:56 PM</a>  on April 9, 2015

<br>
<em>That's what bugs me about this whole bit. I've been reading SF since the goddamn 80s. I enjoy liberal/leftist writers (Mieville, Lynch, GRRM) and I enjoy right-wing writers (Wolfe, and Wolfe again, because it's Gene Fucking Wolfe). I even enjoy bad right-wing stories written well (like Wolfe's "Devil in a Forest"). I don't enjoy books by left-wing writers I felt didn't live up to my expectations as a reader (Scalzi's "Lock In," for example. Love you, Scalz, but that one was predictable and by-the-numbers).<br>
What I've been loving about sf of late is that more and more writers, with more and more interesting voices, are finally putting out stuff that is about more than Biff McLargeHuge and his Space-o-blaster taking down Space Lord, Motherfucker on the Forbidden Planet X. There was a time that campy shit was OK, but that time was the 1950s. C'mon, we live in a world post-Moorcock! Ursula LeGuin has already written revolutionary literary sf. Gene Wolfe's entire literary career stretches behind him pointing out that good sf and good literature aren't two different things.<br>
Harold Bloom's bulbous head is thrown back in cackling laughter as regressive idiots within the Puppies' groups will gleefully squander any sort of respectability sf has clawed from literary critics' upturned noses. Hell, we have lit darlings like Chabon openly acknowledging Moorcock. Even Margaret Atwood has grudgingly admitted that, "ok, yes, speculative fiction, fine!" when describing her own stories after being famously anti-sf her entire career.<br>
And why not? Look who wants to be the public face of speculative fiction? A bunch of nerds who are upset that books can be about things other than mighty-thewed barbarians slaying monsters and running off with lusty women. News flash -- Robert E. Howard has already lived and died, Conan is a thing, you cannot so S&amp;S better than he has, so stop trying. Also, we've already properly deconstructed that trope. It was called the Elric saga, and it was fucking magical, and Michael Goddamn Moorcock should bludgeon every Puppy he sees. He is our goddamn Grandmaster on the Mountain and they will show him the proper respect.<br>
All of these regressive assholes longing for the "good old days" when character development was nil, plot was an excuse to engage in world-building, and a theme or wider message was something of a dirty word to people who wanted puerile escapist adventure stories... your lost golden age never existed. Yes, there were times when those characteristics defined the majority of "genre" writing, and they still do today. I'm a member of several online crit groups, and the amount of, "lulz I turned my D&amp;D game into a story you have to read it" and "The Space Knight glanced down from his Space Ship at the Space Planet and thought space things about the space women he would meet in Space City," crop up far too often. Your pulp adventure longings are an attempt to seize something that never was. SF has always been literary, the titans of the genre have always been here, and there's a reason we've recognized them at the Hugos -- their work is better and more meaningful than anything Torgeson or Correia or their ilk have ever, or will ever put out.<br>
Not because of politics. See above: Gene Wolfe is so Republican he would shit on these young pups who dare pretend to claim his side of the political spectrum. But he's also probably one of the most subtle and intelligent writers I know, genre or lit. He's up there with Melville and Nabokov. He writes intelligent, witty, meaningful, art. Correia writes shit. That's as simple as a comparison as needs be said.</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/169560" target="_self">Charlemagne In Sweatpants</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003683" target="_self">3:14 AM</a>  on April 10, 2015

<i>I hate what the Puppies did. It was based on false premises, and though it was not illegal, it was mean-spirited and unsportsmanlike. So how about we do NOT prove them right by rigging the rules against Sad Puppies 4? How about we try to be better than that? There is nothing wrong with the Hugo rules. If we want to defeat the Puppies, all we need to do is outvote them. Get in our own nominations. This year, the Puppies emptied the kennels and got out their vote, and we didn't. Fandom danced the usual, "oh, too busy to nominate, I will just vote on the final ballot," and for that complacency, we got blindsided. We lost. They kicked our fannish asses, and now we have the ballot they gave us.

		<a name="6003888"></a><div class="comments"><i>Maybe the whole thing is just broken and should be abandoned.</i><br>
<br>
Possibly, but not certainly. <br>
<br>
The issue with the current system is the nomination process. The vote itself is fine. Well, this year's vote will suck, because the nominations are full of the suck, but the vote process itself will be fine.<br>
<br>
We could...<br>
<br>
(Note. I advocate none of these here. I'm just listing options.)<br>
<br>
1) Limit the number of nominations a given person could make, and increase the number of finalists on the ballot. This would limit the effect of the slates. The fact that you could nominate five and there are five finalists meant a slate of five could sweep the ballot. 2 out 6 cannot. This is, by far, the simplest thing to do. It's not perfect -- you can still get two names on the ballot easily. <br>
<br>
2) Have a jury select, say, 30 works, have the members nominate 5, then vote 1. The weakness then moves to the jury, and I'm sure we'd want to have a rolling jury comprised of the previous couple Worldcons, the current one, and the next seated Worldcon. Yes, you could try to steal a Worldcon, but then you have to run one. That's self-correcting. Ever worked one of them? They're big fussy hard to deal with things. <br>
<br>
3) Ignore it and hope they get bored and go away. If they keep stealing the awards for crap, they'll either get No Awarded *or* the value of the Hugo drops to nothing. <br>
<br>
4) Use a system where once one of your nominations makes the ballot, your remaining nominations are removed. Thus, instead of getting 5 nominations, you are getting 5 chances at making one nomination on the final ballot. This makes slates larger than one impossible, but does require you to rank your nominations. It also means we'd need to write the software to handle the nomination count, because it would be complex. <br>
<br>
5) Increase the supporting membership costs, or even eliminate the supporting membership entirely. $40 is one thing, $200 is another, and it makes assembling a wild pack of nominators who would not otherwise attend much more expensive. It would not, of course, affect assembling such a pack of those who were attending anyway, they've already paid the piper.<br>
<br>
6) Make it so that the current Worldcon *only* elects, the previous *only* nominates, thus doubling the cost of slate voting -- you have to join two cons to see it through. The reason for the current system (previous, current, and next if you join before Jan 31st of the current year) is to increase the nomination pool, this would explicitly decrease it. <br>
<br>
7) More members of WSFS, who have already paid, actually nominating and voting would really help. If everyone did, 150 member slates might not be enough to reach the final ballot in the face of 35,000 nominations (7K members, 5 noms per member.) The reason 150 could do it is they wielded 450 nominations out of 2000 or less. <br>
<br>
8) A rule that increased the final ballot size in the face of a slate means that the primary harm of the slate -- knocking off nominees who would have made it without the slate vote -- doesn't happen. This has issues, of course, there are real costs to nominees, the biggest two being the pre-Hugo reception (aka, get them in one room and get some food into them) and the Hugo Loser's party (aka, get the losers into one room and let them relax before facing the world. The winners usually can't wait to get on the party floor holding the new shiny.) <br>
<br>
9) This list is by no mean conclusive. <br>
<br>
<br>
The old way? It is almost certainly done. But the goal of the Hugo -- the awards granted by WSFS by WSFS members -- can still be accomplished. Again, we (that being, those of us who've spent time working the con and going to the business meetings) always knew that if a dedicated slate tried, they could dominate a ballot. I doubt we can reëstablish the old social rule of "don't slate vote" so we do have to do something in the long term if we want to save the Hugos.<br>
<br>
But they aren't dead yet.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003888" target="_self">10:23 AM</a>  on April 10, 2015

<br>
There is the matter, however, of this and next years awards. The nominations and election process of the Hugo Awards is written into the <a href="http://www.wsfs.org/bm/rules.html">WSFS Constitution</a>, and one of the little details in that document is that changes to the constitution require approval at the business meeting, then ratification at the *next* Worldcon's business meeting. So, the next Hugo Award that could operate under new nomination rules will be 2017. This year's and 2016's will operate under the current rules, and thus, are vulnerable to the slates. <br>
<br>
This year's are almost impossible to fix. Almost<sup>*</sup>. But assuming miracles don't happen, the best we can do is fairly vote the few non-slate candidates, and No Award the rest. Another option is to declare the whole thing hopelessly compromised and No Award the entire ballot (the nuclear option.)<br>
<br>
In 2016, we could try to deflect the slate with our own. Basically, this means we essentially have to run a public nominations system before the actual nominations, then when the real nominations open, we all fill in whoever "won" publicly. I don't have the space to list all the ways this could go wrong. But, it is at least theoretically possible we could have functional awards next year, because everyone will be going into it aware of what could happen and be taking steps. <br>
<br>
Will those steps work? Got me. But it won't be like this year. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* The Almost -- Look at Section 3.13. The Retrospective Hugos. If we No Award the entire slate, and it has to be *every single Hugo*, then 2015 would be a year when no Hugo Awards were given. We could then amend 3.13 to include, say, 3 years as an interval, and run the 2015 Retro Hugos in 2018 under the new rules and basically redo this.<br>
<br>
But it demands that not one single award be given this year. I'd love to see that happen so we could have another chance, but I'm not sanguine that we could pull it off.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6003898" target="_self">10:33 AM</a>  on April 10, 2015

No one but them thinks this was a clever stunt. They succeeded in flipping off the other side in what was already mutual animosity -- yay them -- but also everyone who cares about the Hugos who didn't have a beef with them like, say, the people who put Correia and Torgerson on the Campbell ballot and Torgerson on the Hugo ballot the first time around.<br>
<br>
This isn't going to make Worldcon a friendlier place for them.<br>

I just read Correia's response to GRRM. I knew he liked him some guns -- I read Monster Hunter International and it's more than a little hard to miss -- but I didn't know he owned a gun store. Or that he was a Mormon.<br>

		<a name="6003940"></a><div class="comments">I don't think GRRM's read all the proposals. There *are*, in fact, a whole lot of really bad ones out there. He needn't worry. The Business Meeting Regulars will spend about 10 minutes with the OTC shotgun and mow them down in short order. Indeed, I'm pretty sure most of them won't even make it to the business meeting, guys like Kevin, Ben, Tim and the Gang of Mikes are busy talking to people and damping down the worst ideas. <br>
<br>
In particular, ones allowing an administrator to reject nominations by judgement call not only need to die in a fire, if they ever pass, I'm renouncing the award forever. I'm with him 100000% on that one. <br>
<br>
The 4/6 and 2/6 proposal change things so that a slate can't sweep a ballot. You can still get 4 or 2 on the ballot, but you cannot take the whole ballot. Indeed, a 1/5 proposal *ends* slates on the same category. If you can only nominate one person, there's no room for a slate in that category. They don't completely remove the harm of campaigning, but they do prevent what happened this year. They are the simplest answer with the least side effects. I personally like 2/6, then 2/5, then 1/5. I think 4/6 is too many, but we're fighting the traditional 5/5, and 2/5 may be seen as too drastic.  <br>
<br>
Mike Scott's expand-a-ballot tries to accept slates by mitigating the damage. The problem with it (and he's the first to acknowledge this) is he's writing it without the data we need to set the key variables His current formula: Take the total number of nominations, subtract the number of nominations the top nominee received (only one of them if a tie) and then take 10% of that number. Any one with more than that number makes the final ballot. It also eliminates the 5% rule -- currently, even if it's in the top five, a nominee that doesn't receive 5% of the nominations doesn't make the ballot.<br>
<br>
But until we actually see the numbers from this year, we don't know if 10% is the right value, or if subtracting the top nominee is a good marker for a slate. So, we really can't propose it this year unless the ceremony is early enough in the con that we can amend the proposal if needed before the main business meeting. I told Mike that my prediction is that we'll either add about 60 people to the ballot (meaning the numbers he set worked) or 0 (meaning they didn't.) They did work for 2014 and 2013, but added a few others, which implies 10% may be too low.

He can try. $40 SAIT. The Worldcons will love his money. And that threat has made *my* choice even clearer. No Award *all the way.* Indeed, clearly it's time to raise the supporting membership cost. <br>
<br>
But NA is a lot hard to pull off than getting on the ballot. The current nomination is really Fifth Past The Post voting. For NA to win, it has to fully win a STV ballot. <br>
<br>
Threatening the entire membership and the award itself, though, is a great way to get it.

Yeah, shit, you're dead right there. You just moved me from 1/5 to the (2-4/5-6) group, and I think 3/5 or 3/6 may in fact be the sweet spot. This means the 4/6 proposal isn't far off and somebody's already moving that one (they were before all this, actually.)  <br>

<blockquote>SFFdom has not been immune to this societal tendency to give straight white guys more, treat them more kindly, eagerly open doors to them that are firmly shut against others. For every John Campbell who openly refused to publish black or woman protagonists, there were likely a few dozen other editors who did the same thing quietly — thus effectively reserving publication spots for white men. White male authors get more reviews (written mostly by white male reviewers), and have a better chance of prominent ones in places like the New York Times Book Review, even though women and people of color buy more books. Women in the business side of the genre get publicly shamed for… well, <em>existing</em>, while white men can be sexual predators or white supremacists and still end up on awards juries or editorial staffs, unquestioned. White protagonists are proudly exhibited on book covers and in the lead roles of films, with little fear of whitewashing; male protagonists are rarely sidelined so that a non-male supporting character can be showcased instead; straight-white-male-centric stories, like Tarzan being the awesomest person on the African continent and endless iterations of “let’s go subdue the natives (in space)” have been granted such pride of place in this genre that for years it was nearly impossible to get published writing anything else. These are our legacy admits, our GI benefits (but only for some GIs), our governors standing in the schoolhouse door. This is the way it’s always been, until very very <em>very</em> recently.<br>
<br>
And just as Abigail Fisher complained only about the 5 black/Latin@ students who beat her out for a seat at U of T <em>but not the 42 white people who did the same</em>, most people in this genre don’t notice the imbalances. They don’t realize that the massive overrepresentation of straight white men in this genre might have an artificial component; they perceive the overrepresentation as normalcy, and assume those people got there strictly on merit.<br>
[...]<br>
Brad Torgersen sees Affirmative Action where only the most minimal efforts at redressing the imbalance exist. He ignores the <em>actual</em> affirmative action which has kept this genre — and this country — mired in a virtual caste system since its inception. But hilariously, he and his cronies have resorted to a lesser version of the very same tactics that his forbears used to defend their hoarded privileges — like enlisting the aid of violent bigots, and blatantly hamstringing processes intended to be fair.<br>

Affirmative action has been at work in SFFdom pretty much since its inception — just not the kind that Brad Torgersen is talking about. And when the various Puppies say they want to take us all back to a golden age of history, it’s clear they haven’t actually <em>studied</em> history… or they might realize they’re replicating some of its ugliest episodes.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004057" target="_self">12:14 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

<br>
Yes, but they still have less nominations and they have to spread them out, which makes the slate much less effective. Assume they have 150 people willing to drop the $40. They get, currently, 5 nominations per category, so 750 total nominations, and they spend them evenly on 5 candidates, 150 per candidate. <br>
<br>
With a 2/6, they only have 300 total nominations. If they split three ways to try to cover the entire slate, they have 100 nominations in each group, and thus only 50 per candidate. It's an enormous difference when it comes to covering an entire slate. They can get the 150 per candidate they have now, but only on two candidates, the other 4 slots are untouched. <br>
<br>
Yes, you can always game things, but you can also set the rules to make gaming more-or-less effective. With the current setup and the size of the current nomination pool, 150 lockstep nominators own the ballot. With a 2/6, they might own a couple of the smaller categories but by and large, they actually hurt themselves if they tried to grab the entire slate. They would certainly own two slots if they chose to do that, but they risk losing slots if they try for the whole ballot.<br>
<br>
Combine that with the fact that fandom is now paying attention, and I suspect 50 votes won't be enough to get on the ballot -- because I think there will be a lot more people nominating next year.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004138" target="_self">1:29 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

That's what will really protect the process, far more than changing the rules. Elections are won by those who show up. There's also a good chance that the Puppies will declare a victory regardless of the actual Hugo results ("Look at how much time and effort and money the SJWs spent proving that they totally hate us!

<br>
I don't give a flying fuck how they feel. Why do you? If they want to feel all hurt, they can. The hurty corner is over there. They can live with whatever conspiracies they want to. Doesn't bother me at all. <br>
<br>
They either win a Hugo, or they do not win a Hugo. How they feel about it? Absolutely no concern of mine. I don't vote the Hugos based on how the authors -- a number of whom I'm honored to call friends -- feel. I vote for the best works, unless they're not on the ballot, then I vote No Award. <br>
<br>
Why?  Because that's what authors who *really care* about the award want. They want to win it because they went against the best that year and won. Charlie (forex) would probably be pissed if I voted for his books because he was a friend. I ranked his books on my ballot where I thought they should rank. Sometimes, he wins. Sometimes, he doesn't, which makes the Hugos he does have *that much more meaningful to him.* It would be an insult to the winners, to the losers, and to everyone who cares about the award to do anything but vote what you think are the best works.<br>
<br>
Fuck how anybody feels about it at the end of the day, because the people I care about agree with me. To make sure the award has meaning, you vote for the best works, not for how anybody feels about it at the end of the day. <br>

<br>
Agree, but I see his point. To use a sports analogy, it's like changing the rules because one team beat you. Except, of course, professional sports do this all the time....<br>
<br>
He's afraid of a bad rule getting in (as am I) and he's afraid that any rule that could be use to exclude SP3/RP nominations could be used to exclude others. He's dead right about that. He's afraid of judgement calls, and yep, he's right about that as well. <br>
<br>
I think he's missing thing like the 4/6 proposal, which while limiting each voters nominations a bit, increases the ballot, and Mike Scott's, which *only* increases, never decreases, the ballot. <br>
<br>
But really, his position -- "when in doubt, do not change the rules" -- is a good one to have. Far too many times bad rule changes happen when people panic. See, well, the entire Department of Homeland Security. <br>
<br>
So I don't fault him for it. I disagree with him, but I don't fault him for it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004199" target="_self">2:15 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

Just remember. It's $40, SAIT. <br>
<br>
Fandom pays the membership for other reasons, in fact, they usually pay the much more expensive attending membership. They look at the Hugo noms and vote as a bonus. <br>

<br>
A better way to look at is: would you, if the situation is reversed, donate $40 to an effort opposing them? While i recognize that not everyone is in this position, 40$ for a lot of people is kind of normal for a donation to an ideologically centered organization. NRA memberships are $35 yearly, as are a lot of other memberships that people shell out for specifically to do lobbying. If you think of $40 as more of a 'Sad Puppies Membership Fee', I don't think it's unlikely that people will pay it year after year, particularly if they get $40 worth of reaction and fight out of it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004223" target="_self">2:37 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

I do. Trolls get bored -- or distracted. Now, if No Award doesn't take a bunch of categories this year, then the award isn't worth a damn. That will be sad, but true. What you won't see. You won't see them getting any sales. You won't see any more Hugo Award Winner displayed. You won't see "Hugo Award Winning Author" on book covers. <br>
<br>
Basically, the award will just fall to nothingness. It happens. Everything ends. <br>
<br>
But there's a reason people are still talking about this a week after the nominations were announced. Right now, it does mean something to many people. And they're fighting for it. <br>
<br>
We will see. The ballot will open soon.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004280" target="_self">3:30 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

<br>
And we would simply reject those ballots as "Not a natural person" and/or "One person/one vote" violations. That's been tried before -- Scientology tried it. Mailed in a bunch of ballots. Memberships paid in sequential money orders. *Bloop* went the ballots into the trashcan. <br>
<br>
If we found out that one person is buying memberships in exchange for you voting their slate, we can legitimately reject those ballots/nominations. Worldcons have done it before. I'm guessing that there was no evidence that Sasquan could see that the SP3/RP slate was paid for by other people. Telling people to vote your slate? Legal. Buying their membership in exchange for voting your slate? Violates 1p1v, since the actual member doesn't get the vote, the person buying does. <br>
<br>
Note that buying someone a membership is not illegal and does not deny them voting rights, so long as the person you bought the membership for gets a fully independent vote. If you insist on *any* condition, even "You have to nominate me in this one category" or even "You cannot nominated this guy" then we can toss that ballot, because it breaks the 1p1v rule.  <br>
<br>
Obviously, this can be hard to detect. But if you ran a kickstarter, bought a stack load of memberships from it, and they all nominated you, we'd drop every single one of those ballots on the floor, without a moments hesitation. <br>
<br>
By rule, the committee hosting that year's Worldcon is, by default, ineligible for a Hugo. They can make themselves eligible if they devolve complete control to a subcommittee. At that point, the members of that subcommittee are ineligible, but they have *sole* power to validate ballots, and nobody can overrule them, but the rest of the concom is eligible again. By practice, this is always done because it provides a nice firewall between the committee as a whole and the vote<br>
<br>
Really, the Hugo Admin is All Powerful here. They make eligibility judgements, they make the call on ballot validity, and there is no appellate. Apparently, there's no evidence of this so of thing happening this year, at least not on any scale. If people *choose* to pay their own money and vote the SP3/RP slates, that's perfectly legal. If they were bought memberships and choose to vote those slates, that's borderline, but if they honestly chose without any pressure from the person who paid for the membership, it's legal -- otherwise, if a spouse pays for both their and their partners' ballots, the partner couldn't nominate/vote.  It's only an invalid nomination if there was any constraints on voting attached to that membership.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004316" target="_self">4:08 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

The reavers will be perfectly happy to put up a website which assigns with of two slates to vote for, and thus their overall roughly 10x advantage in voting power will remain (since other voters will also be reduced.). If it helps at all, it will likely be by reducing the diversity of the nominations the good-faith voters put up (I don't know if it will, but in theory it might if the items with the most nominations are also appear preferentially in the top half of the nominators' personal rankings.)<br>

It does have the advantage of being simple, but the only solution I really see working long term is a jury step, or possibly one of the more complex schemes that automatically expands the list in reaction to slate voting.

		<a name="6004609"></a><div class="comments">Except that the people nominating normally will also have their voting power reduced. It might help a tiny bit if there are real works sitting just behind the puppy numbers, and that might be true for Best Novel (where at least one book still out nommed the puppies) but because the puppies are voting the slate, not if they've read, they are drowning the smaller categories.  If current is:<br>
<br>
Each nominator gets five votes, a thousand people vote, 900 real and 100 puppies, there are<br>
<br>
Real Work A appears on 90 slates<br>
Real Work B appears on 80 slates<br>
Real Work C appears on 60 slates<br>
Real Work D appears on 50 slates<br>
Real Work E appears on 30 slates<br>
Real Work F appears on 20 slates<br>
<br>
Puppy works P1 through P5 appear on 100 slates, voting is blocked.<br>
<br>
So now if people can only nom 3, then assuming the preferences for each of A through F are spread equally, ie A was the 1 favorite of 18 voters, the 2 favorite of 18 voters, etc, then all that happens is that it is now:<br>
<br>
Real Work A appears on 54 slates<br>
Real Work B appears on 48 slates<br>
Real Work C appears on 36 slates<br>
Real Work D appears on 30 slates<br>
Real Work E appears on 18 slates<br>
Real Work F appears on 12 slates<br>
<br>
And Puppy works P1 through P6 appear on 50 slates, and only one real work makes it through.  And that's where there are nearly enough nominations for real works; in cases like the shorter fiction awards, the slate is block voting close to twice the numbers of even the most nominated works. <br>
<br>
So it helps a tiny bit, as will more nominations in general, but it still doesn't cure the fundamental problem of slates, in that slates have 10x the power of people voting their sincere pick for best X when there are hundreds of 'candidates'.  Which means that even people of goodwill will feel they have to start assembling slates, which means the Hugos turn into a political election, instead of a poll of sincere opinions of the best of the year. And at that point, what's the point?<br>
<br>
Which is why my opinion is that if they are to survive, a juried filter will probably be necessary.  Which is not great -- if you pick from previous Hugo winners, it will tend towards backwards-looking nominations (since the ones most likely to not have works in contention and willing to serve as jurors will also be the oldest.)  And it's hard to get a truly balanced and diverse jury of varied tastes.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/111261" target="_self">tavella</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6004609" target="_self">7:53 PM</a>  on April 10, 2015

		<a name="6004634"></a><div class="comments">O.K., this is a stretch, but bear with me.  In the 80's, I spent way too much time watching movies instead of studying.  And I got obsessed by <em>Some Kind of Wonderful</em>, a John Hughes written re-write, kind of, of every other damn film he'd made to that date.  Obsessed to the point of actually comparing it, seriously (and to my eternal embarrassment) to Romeo and Juliet.<br>
<br>
But Correia's response to GRRM got me thinking, and I realized his story replicates <em>Some Kind of Wonderful</em> to a frightening extent.  In the movie, you've got Eric Stoltz playing this wrong side of the tracks kid who wants to be an artist, who's in love with Lea Thompson, a hot classmate who's dating some rich snobby Corvette-driving fuck.  And then there's Mary Stuart Masterson's character, a drum-playing tomboy who's Stoltz's best friend, and who is really secretly in love with him.  <br>
<br>
And it's all class warfare-y, with the rich snobby fucks making Eric Stoltz's life miserable because he's so, you know, good and earnest, that Lea's Thompson's kind of interested in him after all. And they cleverly plan to beat him up at a party thrown by one of the rich snobby fucks, but their plans are foiled by his even more clever plan to invite a bunch of quasi-delinquents (with whom he's bonded in detention) to crash the party in order to intimidate the rich snobby fucks.  And that scene ends with some of the quasi-delinquents being given come-hither looks by the rich snobby fucks' girlfriends. <br>
<br>
And then Stoltz's character demonstrates his eternal love for the Thompson character by breaking into the local art museum to show her a (pretty crappy) portrait of her which he's had hung in the museum by one of the quasi-delinquents, whose father is a museum guard.  Stunned by the overall marvelousness of the Stoltz character's passion, and his skill as an artist, Thompson makes the supreme sacrifice and decides to let him go, so that he can discover that he REALLY loves the Mary Stuart Masterson tomboy best friend character.  And those two drive off into the sunset in a limousine  he'd rented to impress the Thompson character.  That's most of it, shorn of a couple of other sub-plots about money and class and annoying little sisters which don't really apply here.<br>
<br>
But, BUT,  this is Larry Correia's life.  He's the Eric Stoltz character being mistreated by the rich snobby fucks, who are probably planning on beating him up at the next con.  And he's an artist!  And the quasi-delinquent friends?  That seems pretty clear, doesn't it?  But now, with their help, he's turned the tables on the rich snobby SJW fucks, who have lost their girlfriends to the quasi-delinquents.  The only thing I can't figure out is who the Lea Thompson character is.  I think the Masterson character is 'normal' SFF fandom, who don't want to show that we're secretly in love with this other-side-of-the-tracks genuine artist.  It's the Thompson hot teenager character that I can't quite pin down.  I suspect it's VD.  That makes some kind of twisted sense. But maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe it's all of the SPs, collectively.<br>

		<a name="6005037"></a><div class="comments">So, I've been reading some of the posts by the organizers and defenders of the Puppies, and there is a strong strain of, "No, we are NOT racist, misogynistic, and homophobic, and how dare you call us that!"   (Including at least one classic, "Actually it is our opponents who are the TRUE racists!")  They often point to the scattering of women and minorities on their slate as evidence, and sometimes offer evidence from their personal lives.<br>
<br>
It kind of falls apart under examination, though.<br>
<br>
If we look at what the organizers of the two Puppy slates claim their goals were, we see three very different claims (I am, of course, paraphrasing):<br>
<br>
TORGENSEN: We just want the vote to go to rollicking sci-fi adventure stories that don't make you think, which is what people really like!  The other side is the one that votes on ideology!<br>
<br>
CORREIA: No, we are totally voting on ideology because the other side did it first!  But it's not a sexist, racist, homophobic ideology!  (Also they were MEAN to me!)<br>
<br>
DAY: BURN THE INFIDEL WITH FIRE!!!!!<br>
<br>
Looking at the three, Torgensen's falls apart with a poke.  His slate is supposed to be all about rollicking sci-fi adventure stories?  Then why does it include things like "Wisdom From My Internet" (from "Patriarchy Press"), which appears to be a rambling collection of right-wing political jokes with no sci-fi content?  I find it hard to believe he's fooling anyone other than himself, if that.<br>
<br>
Correia is at least more honest that these are, deliberately, ideological lists.  His basic claim is that the Popular Kids vote on left-wing ideology rather than writing quality, so he got together a bunch of the Unpopular Kids to pack the nominations with right-wing authors and ideology rather than quality, so there.  His claims that Only Left Wing Books Can Get A Look Now And Heinlein Books Would Never Make The Ballot Today seem dubious to me (and somewhat ironic, since his slate probably kept a well-regarded biography of Heinlein off the award ballot), but at least his stated motives hold up a little better.  It's an ideological slate, which is why it mostly looks like one.<br>
<br>
However, he is also at pains to state that the Puppies have no motives which are sexist, racist, and homophobic; they are just yay for guns and capitalism types that want a fair shake.  There's kind of a big problem with that, though, which is his deafening silence about Vox Day when he talks about this stuff.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is, the slate that got on -- the slate that got the most votes out of the Puppy followers -- was really the Rabid Puppy slate, not the Sad Puppy slate.  That's where the heart of the voters was.  And the Rabid Puppy slate is quite vocal about its ideology, and what that ideology is.  John C. Wright did not get nominated six times because he is having a career best year that somehow all the critics and other awards missed.  He did not even get nominated six times because he is yay for guns and capitalism.  He got nominated six times, mostly by Vox Day and his followers, because he is the kind of guy who has an internet meltdown over two girls holding hands on Legend of Korra.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Correia himself is sexist, racist, homophobic, or what have you.  But he is sure acting like the nomination vote, which was primarily for an admittedly racist, sexist, homophobic ideology, was a victory for his side.  And he sure has never said, "Hey, I know there's some overlap between Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies, but let me be clear, those guys, the ones who got most of the votes on this, we don't support what they stand for."  Which, given the circumstances, is kind of a statement he needs to make right now if it's one he feels is true.<br>
<br>
Which leaves me pretty much left with the belief that the ideology most of the puppies are following is the one that got the most votes, and the one that one organizer supports wholeheartedly and the other two have taken no pains to distance themselves from: BURN THE INFIDEL WITH FIRE.<br>
<br>
It sure isn't about rollicking sci-fi adventure, I can tell you that much.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005037" target="_self">9:29 AM</a>  on April 11, 2015

Is there a word for that sort of thing?  They do it all the time.  The media is liberal!  Instead of creating an unbiased network to do it right, create Fox News.  Wikipedia is liberal!  Instead of creating an unbiased encyclopedia they create Conservapedia.  Facebook is liberal! Instead of creating an unbiased social network, they create Tea Party Community.  In every case, the existence of bias in the original source is questionable at best but the conservative alternative is clearly, clearly extreme.<br>

<br>
Where are - I ask this sincerely - the people offering to create something welcoming for the more conservative SF writers? Where are the people trying to welcome Wright and Correia to the table? Because, yes, Wright did indeed have an epic Gandalf meltdown over Legend of Corra -  but he is also indeed, undeniably, a very prolific science fiction writer. He should not be excluded from fandom, much less awards, because he is a vocal and devoted True Believer  of his religion. <small>(I could even say that golden plates being awarded by a god-like creature which require a Babelfish Stone placed in a hat to read should count as EXTRA SCIENCE FICTION but I will mostly refrain.)</small><br>
<br>
And Larry Correia has written an incredibly heartfelt and personal piece talking about exclusion - about being treated badly even by those with experience of being treated badly who have sworn not to treat others in that way. Where are people reaching out to him from the other side, and offering to meet him for beers and talk about their beliefs in a friendly way? <small>(Mind you I think GRRM probably will, but he's not really fully on the Other Side, more a mountain of the community holding out his hand and calling 'Stop!')</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005193" target="_self">1:37 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

		<a name="6005200"></a><div class="comments">It's an interesting question, <strong>jeather</strong> - but I actually think, specifically within the context of cons, because of the weird structure of parallel tracks - that there totally can be.<br>
<br>
Like, if 'Religious Oriented SF' wants to have a track at cons, puts up its own people for panels, and runs its own shebang, that is not functionally impacting other people at the con who choose not to go to their panels, as long as they still have to abide by anti-harassment rules about dealing with other con participants. <br>
<br>
We absolutely have the ability, within the context of conventions, to have welcome space for everyone, as long as we can all commit to a policy of <em>don't be shitty to each other.</em><br>
<br>
And so for example, you can say, "Hey Tom Kratman, you're totally welcome to come to con, but the first time you say something shitty <small>and he totally will</small> you are banned from con for the remainder of the year. Next time it's five years. Next time it's 'don't come back'." And you can do that completely without referring to his beliefs, by making it about his <em>actions at con.</em> And you can also say, "Hey, we know Tom Kratman is a dick, but it is not okay to go to his panels specifically to call him a dick." And that also takes it out of the realm of ideology, and puts it into the realm of "Con is not an appropriate place to confront people publicly for what you feel about their beliefs."<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005200" target="_self">1:49 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

Which table? Whose table? Because they already have seats at the table, based on their book sales, award nominations, award wins. How is that somehow them not being at the table?<br>
<br>
There is nothing inherently not-conservative (politically, at least) about including rounded characters of a variety of races, sexes, sexual orientations, and the like from stories authors write. <br>
<br>
I would personally never reach out to someone like Wright, because the stuff he's said about <em>people who are me</em> does not make me think he would accept it even if I were able to put aside my antipathy towards ignorant homophobes.

Could you do a track that is "The problem of SJW fiction" which would be presumably called something less overt? What about "The white guy authors of the 50s and why fiction today sucks in comparison"? Are you not allowed to disagree (politely) afterwards? Because either way, I think the con becomes unwelcome to people. (And I think a lot of people would feel unwelcome if there was a track of programming that had those topics -- a program that is "we care about this subgenre" is very different from "we don't like these people".)<br>
<br>
Remember that JCW had a fit when animated characters held hands -- would you need to make rules about PDAs in order to make him feel welcome at a con? We're not just talking about allowed, we're talking about feeling welcome. <br>
<br>
I really do not imagine there could be a group that talks about science fiction and fantasy that could make both JCW and LBGTQ people feel welcome.

Wright is Catholic, not Mormon, and I am a vocal and devoted "true believer" of the same religion, without being a gigantic dickhead about it. It's not his Catholicism fandom objects to; it's that he uses religion as a weapon of hate. You don't to excuse your personal hatefulness because "God said so." Indeed, I'd argue that he should be held to a higher standard of moral behavior, and probably not lean on an all-loving God while saying things like, <em>"You are disgusting, limp, soulless sacks of filth. You have earned the contempt and hatred of all decent human beings forever, and we will do all we can to smash the filthy phallic idol of sodomy you bow and serve and worship.

Exactly. Wright can go first.<br>
<br>
I mean, get real. Don't keep acting like John C. Wright is some paragon of moral virtue being unfairly excluded by The Mean People. He's an angry, hate-filled person who vents his spleen with alarming frequency. I mean, here's what he says about people who think Muslim terrorists don't represent all of Islam:
<blockquote>"No one can explain Leftism any more than anyone can explain the Fall of Lucifer. To be sure, some theorize that Leftists are utterly depraved and evil and love making false accusations merely because they are evil. Others theorize that Leftists are utterly stupid and actually believe their own unconvincing lies because they are too stupid to be skeptical about such transparent and obvious and unconvincing bullshit. Other point to the reproductive strategies of rabbits or to arrested brain development leading to he growth of gonads, producing a hysterical fear complex rendering the Leftist unable to face reality or even think about it, but also unable to shut up his damnable mouth. This addiction to unreality combined with a neurotic inability to shut his damnable mouth forces the pathetic yet annoying Leftist utter statements utterly unrelated to reality. He must, must utter such statements even though he knows that they are stupid; but the internal pressure of his own gormlessness forces him, unwillingly, to humiliate himself in public, while decent men look on, aghast at the grotesque display. ...  Bigots hate. That is what they do. Leftists are bigots. Hatred and more hatred, whining hatred, irrational hatred, frothing brain-diseased incomprehensible epileptic hatred is their only stock in trade. That is what they sell. That is all they sell. They are HATE-R-US. And even when world civilization hangs in the balance, they would rather fling open the gates to the barbarian, and watch the world burn, and die themselves, rather than live with themselves, knowing that there is a Christian or a Jew or a White Man or a Rich Man anywhere on the globe living a happy and contended life."</blockquote>

<br>
Sorry about the Catholic v Mormon error - I must be more tired than I thought, or maybe was just mixing him up with Torg. <br>
<br>
I don't know that Wright is good and decent or polite in person. I really mean that - I have no idea! But the thing I'm trying to hang my hat on is more 'Let them come, be welcoming to them, and then if they pick up their own feces and fling it at someone, push them out  the door."<br>
<br>
Because the thing is - if Wright simply cannot control verbal diarrhea and is going to say something shitty to someone, then he's going to say something shitty to someone and that makes it a really clear ban at that point. But banning people for how you think they're going to act - particularly when there are often really huge differences between people's Behavior When Someone Is Wrong On The Internet and people's Behavior In Real Life - or just what you think you'll be thinking in their head - is just a bad idea and really does a lot to tear down the inclusive nature of fandom in a way that I think does permanent harm. And even with Wright as an example - sure, he wrote a strong post about his reaction to Terry Pratchett talking about euthanasia to applause, but did he say anything at the con itself? Does anyone have any instances of Wright Was Cruel To Me Personally In Person?<br>
<br>
I posted earlier about just having been to a con - I took my kid, who has had difficulty making friends, as every adolescent does, to convention, and she was nervous about it, but it was so great and she was having so much fun and everyone was nice to her even though she has FriendStoppingAdolescentIssues. <br>
<br>
And I guess a lot of my anger and upsetness over this whole thing is kind of about how there's a nice place that doesn't have to be shit on, and fuck it we don't have to be fighting like this is life or death.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005247" target="_self">2:37 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

<br>
We absolutely have the ability, within the context of conventions, to have welcome space for everyone, as long as we can all commit to a policy of don't be shitty to each other.<br>
<br>
And so for example, you can say, "Hey Tom Kratman, you're totally welcome to come to con, but the first time you say something shitty and he totally will you are banned from con for the remainder of the year. Next time it's five years. Next time it's 'don't come back'." And you can do that completely without referring to his beliefs, by making it about his actions at con. And you can also say, "Hey, we know Tom Kratman is a dick, but it is not okay to go to his panels specifically to call him a dick." And that also takes it out of the realm of ideology, and puts it into the realm of "Con is not an appropriate place to confront people publicly for what you feel about their beliefs."</em><br>

But that he's Catholic in RL (which I honestly didn't know until now) makes the end of the novel more understandable, at least.

<br>
Hmmm. I think for me - the minimum bar would be a clear sense that harassment to them will be treated like any other kind of harassment, which is to say Not Tolerated - I vividly remember when people were saying that if Elizabeth Moon went to Wiscon, they would stalk her to every panel to let her know how upset they were, and it was very upsetting to hear. A clear sense that you can't say nasty things to people or follow them to panels just to confront them just because you don't like their views, and that doing so will have real consequences, regardless of what their views are.<br>
<br>
And beyond that - in the social 'What We Should Do' sort of sense - I think just treating them like they're an average con goer. Being friendly and helpful and kind and part of the family. If you're inviting all the writers at the con to a party upstairs, then invite the conservative writers too.

As Jemisin pointed out when discussing Wright's ally <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/08/the-ten-percent/">Vox Day</a>:
<blockquote>Certainly, if the nasty little aggressor in question had had a day-job at most US-based companies of any meaningful size and had expressed similar sentiments as he expressed on SFWA’s twitter feed aloud in the workplace, he’d have been fired. In some companies, he’d have been fired just for posting those thoughts in a public, but not-work-related, forum.</blockquote>

Talking about how to make public spaces more welcoming for--let me repeat--loud and publicly homophobic individuals is deeply unsupportive of queer people.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73881" target="_self">overglow</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005288" target="_self">3:11 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

They are very pleasingly spooky. <br>
<br>
(I think the main reason why the Christian bits in that book irk me slightly is more to do with how it lessens to them a little, much like Derleth's Christian bits lessen Lovecraft.

<br>
We do that here, though. If you participate on AskMe, you have to be friendly and helpful, regardless of what the person asking the question thinks of you and your practices. And moreover, in practice, it plays out. I've answered questions as helpfully as I could for people that I think are deeply, deeply wrong about things - and some people that find my own politics vile have given some really great, helpful responses. And I mean, of course the natural tendency is to say that Mefites are just <em>better</em>, but is there really a reason a similar culture can't mean similar expectations are applied in SF fandom?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005292" target="_self">3:14 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

		<a name="6005302"></a><div class="comments">So it seems like what I'm hearing is that there are lots of conservatives who are not just welcome in but <em>fixtures in</em> fandom. I mean, if your argument hinges on the nonexistence of Tim Powers, you might want to rethink.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, as GRRM proved fairly conclusively, there is no bias against conservative SF authors being nominated for and winning awards.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of authors being publicly aggrieved on the *puppy slates are ... well ... kind of a little bit <em>fucking assholes</em>. I'm not counting Brad Torgersen, but Larry Correia, John C Wright, and VD, certainly. These are people who are publicly and aggressively insulting to people who are not like them on a continual basis.<br>
<br>
Now Larry Correia even acknowledges this, but he says that, "hey, I didn't used to be an aggressively public jerk! I was a real nice guy, and everyone was a jerk to me because I'm a conservative!" And yet his con report from the time doesn't mention this, and, again, non-<em>fucking-asshole</em> conservatives seem to do just fine. <br>
<br>
And also, and I'm speculating, I have a hard time believing that someone who's true self is 'fucking asshole' can mask it all that well for all that long. I suspect that his 'nice guy persona' was not as airtight as he claims.<br>
<br>
Corb, you say that what you think is fair is:<br>
<em>I think just treating them like they're an average con goer. Being friendly and helpful and kind and part of the family.</em><br>
<br>
I know it's been said before, but <em>please</em> consider that the available evidence is that that's <em>exactly</em> what's happening. People are being nice and friendly to people who are nice and friendly to them. People are being hostile to people who are hostile to them. Is it about politics? Well, I doubt Benjanun Sriduangkaew got invited to too many parties by the people she viciously attacked and insulted, either.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/112395" target="_self">Myca</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005302" target="_self">3:20 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

So, like, Corb, I don't think you would expect "Sally," who was called "vile subhuman filth," by Benjanun Sriduangkaew to then invite her to parties and generally hang out with her. And I think that this would probably extend to Sally's friends as well, right?<br>
<br>
I think that there needs to be an understanding that the same rules apply if "Sally," was called "vile subhuman filth," not directly, but obliquely on account of her sexual orientation or race, by John C Wright or Vox Day. <br>
<br>
But if it's about sexual orientation or race, there are a lot more Sallys, and a lot more friends. So yeah.

<br>
Indeed. Gene Wolf is also a very vocal, devoted and conservative member of the same religion. He is also not a giant dickhead about it, I'm honored to know him, he is one of the true greats of the field. <br>
<br>
I feel for Larry Correia in many ways. I feel he's stepped in it, doubled down, and can't understand why he's gotten the reaction he has, but I honestly don't think it's malice. I think if we can step back, we could mend that breach and make him part of the family.  He refusal of the nomination was the right step, I think he realize he was going to cross a line that couldn't be recrossed if he accepted, and he did not. I could be wrong, but I'm not willing to condemn. I feel he has done some wrong to fandom, but many have, including myself, and we can all forgive, learn and grow.<br>
<br>
Jim C. Wright is too busy spewing fire and hate to reach. I don't know if we can ever cross that divide, and unlike Larry C, he's not even willing to try. So, fine. It is what it is. But he's committed one unforgivable sin, and that's he's all in with....<br>
<br>
VD? Holy cow, that's a whole other thing. I honestly, in bones, feel he is, by my morality and standards, the *most evil person I've encountered.* I will not treat with him. There is no negotiation with him. Period. His goal is clear, and simple, and I grant him credit for in no way hiding it, he wants an absolute theocracy, with himself at the head of it, with females little more than slaves in it, and with anybody else who isn't white and Christian either enslaved or dead. <br>
<br>
This is literally the level of evil that has resulted in the legendary genocides of history, and he is *all in* for it. And if this doesn't scare you? You need to read his stuff again. <br>
<br>
And you know what? I had a bit of ephinany last night.<br>
<br>
This has *nothing* to do with the Sad Puppies. They are a shield. Larry C made that list, VD has been hiding behind it. Let's stop calling it what it isn't. It's not the Sad Puppies doing this. It's VD's Rabid Puppies and Gamergate. <br>

Personally, I think Correia crossed the line several months ago. He's pretty firmly in bed with both the RP and GG at this point, and genuinely seems to revel in the hate they spread. He speaks their lingo, he favorably passes on much of the worst they put out, and he's very chummy with their figureheads.

		<a name="6005365"></a><div class="comments"><i> And I mean, of course the natural tendency is to say that Mefites are just better, but is there really a reason a similar culture can't mean similar expectations are applied in SF fandom?</i><br>
<br>
There's a big difference between MeFi and SF Fandom. <br>
<br>
MeFi has a banhammer.<br>
<br>
Everyone here agrees to get along because if you don't, your replies get deleted, if that's not enough clue, you get The Letter From The Mod, and if that doesn't do it, the Banhammer is warmed up and you get a time out. Enough of that and BOOM. You are no longer a MeFite. Everyone here has basically passed a test, and that test is "you will be a reasonable MeFite, or you will not be a MeFite." So, yeah, even when we really disagree, we can talk about it. <br>
<br>
Fandom, historically, has not only been welcoming, but there has been an actively and intense rejection of the very idea of rejecting anyone from fandom. Basically, everyone thought "well, I was nobody until I found fandom, who am I to reject anyone else?" This mutated into the "we have to welcome all" attitude that has pervaded fandom for decades and it is only in *very* recent years that this social rule has been brought into question. The idea of banning someone because of something they said or did somewhere else was tried at the first Worldcon, when a few Michelists (basically, pro-Communists) were barred, and that went over like a dead horse. <br>
<br>
Then there was the Breendoggle. I'll elide the whole sordid affair (note that Walter Breen died in prison a convicted child sex offender and leave it at that) but the whole thing left a very bad impression on fandom (he'd not be convicted or even arrested at the point he was excluded from the Worldcon) and that started the idea that We Do Not Exclude. <br>
<br>
Really, it's only been in the last couple of years that the thought of declaring someone Persona No Grata has really been brought up, and there's still a significant amount of resistance to it, but at least it's no longer a complete faux pas to even bring the idea up.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005365" target="_self">4:04 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

I'd thought that too, but in the last few days, I'm not so sure. I'm not willing to automatically be all chummy with him, but if he were to walk into a bar, buy me a beer and say "can I have a few minutes of your time?", I'd give him that and a fair hearing, and the honor of an honest reply given in a reasonable tone, and if there was common ground, I'd tell him how to reach it, and be honest in how difficult it would be to reach it with many fans. <br>
<br>
But we'll see in the next few weeks. He could just redouble and then we'll know. But in my personal fannish book, while he's not on a good page, he's not written out yet. <br>

<br>
Corb -<br>
<br>
First, I'm glad you're here, I don't agree with you all the time, but you're a valid voice, you're respectful of other people, and truth be told, MeFi does lean strongly  progressive/liberal, and a few strong conservative voices are welcome and needed. <br>
<br>
And I know you catch flack. A couple of people should be glad we don't have dope slap over IP, because they'd have headaches right now. <br>
<br>
But this? I'm willing to welcome those willing to be welcomed and play by the rules and social conventions of the space. Here, the only people we call drunken fuckwits would be people with the username "drunken fuckwits." We don't wish members to be killed, we cry when they die. We don't accept that you walk into the space you've been welcomed into and demand to change the rules and social conventions. If you don't like them, go find your owns spaces, and speaking as a white male, I know *exactly* how easy it is for White Males to find spaces where they can say and do basically whatever the hell they want, including things that are flat out illegal. <br>
<br>
All are welcome here -- but all follow the same rules. We are civil. We discuss the topic. Arguably, I'm really pushing the rules by doing this here and not on MeTa, but I'm bringing this on topic in a sec, so hopefully the mods will give me some doubt, besides, I only posted the Treaty of Westphalia *once* and it was on CAPS LOCK DAY, I'm sorry. <br>
<br>
You, and I, and everyone else here follows the rules, so you, and I, and everyone else is welcome, even if FFFM keeps trying to egg you on AND I WISH THEY'D CUT YOU A BIT OF SLACK OK HINT but I'm not a mod that's a personal opinion anyway where was I?<br>
<br>
If others come into this space, they are welcome too -- so long as they play by the rules and conventions. If they don't, however, *boom* goes the banhammer. <br>
<br>
If they come into a space and demand that all the rules and social conventions be changed to favor them? Then, well, here's where my welcome turns into a spear. I'll be honest, I'm mostly gafiated from fandom right now, but SF Fandom has been a big part of my life, a goodly number of my close friends, I've met there, and this was a deliberate and explicit "fuck you" to them.<br>
<br>
That's why I'm taking this in the spirit of "fuck you back." And why I'm not saying that to you. You? You are playing by the both the rules and the social conventions. I'm good with you being here. Hell, I'm glad you're here. If you're ever in Chicago, let me know, if you drink such, I'll buy you a beer, help find you the right church, if you have diet restrictions, point you to the right place so you can eat, and all that. You're being social here. I will be social there. You've held up your hand, I will embrace it. It's the social condition, and you are playing by it. <br>
<br>
You come in demanding this and that, and you'd have been ban hammered. You didn't, and you are one of the valid voices of the site. Fandom, alas, doesn't have a banhammer.  But socially, that's what's happening, esp. when you look at the stated positions of some of these folk, which involve direct physical harm to my friends and family.<br>
<br>
Forgive me for taking that poorly.<br>
<br>
Anyway. That's why, at least in my opinion, Fandom Has Been Plunged Into War. The odd thing, though, is it's not with itself this time.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005401" target="_self">4:35 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

Reached out in January. If Yiannopolous was a GG cheerleader then, then yes, he's hit a line that'll be very hard to cross back. If that's new, I'm not going to auto-condemn. If you've never talked cordially to someone who turned out to be a complete fuckhead later, you are a really lucky person.<br>

I feel he's stepped in it, doubled down, and can't understand why he's gotten the reaction he has, but I honestly don't think it's malice. I think if we can step back, we could mend that breach and make him part of the family.</em><br>
<br>
I really appreciate you noting that. Honestly, Correia's post hit me like a punch to the gut, because it's so much "I love you and wanted to love you, why is it like this?" I feel the same way about him as I do about Torgersen - who Correia affectionately describes as 'too naive to survive in Westeros'. I think they both seem like really great guys who are disturbed by what they see as wrong - and honestly, I do think they have at least the seeds of a legitimate beef, even if it's not what they see as the biggest one. <br>
<br>
Hell, GRRM, who despite his D/R voting preference, seems to be coming out swinging as knowledgeable and measured as possible on this, has openly admitted a lot of the things they were saying: yes, there has been Hugo campaigning, yes, there are cliques, yes, some of them get things on the ballot that would not have been there, this has all happened before - this is an escalation, but it is not the first step on the path that led here. So it's possible to not be bigoted and to still feel that there are some legitimate points, even if you think some of the stuff is a bridge too far.<br>
<br>
My take on Vox Day is that he's still fuming from his SFWA boot. Honestly, I think here's where Torgensen nails it on the head (linked above); <blockquote>Will anybody listen to me? I know Vox sure as hell doesn’t give a fuck what I think. When did he ever? He didn’t give a fuck when SFWA sent him packing. He doesn’t give a fuck who hates him. If Sad Puppies evaporates tomorrow and ceases to exist, Vox won’t give a shit at all. Because Vox doesn’t give a shit what any of us think, and doesn’t care. When did The Kurgan ever? This is a fight for The Prize. You cut off his head, he cuts off your head.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005474" target="_self">5:54 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

<br>
Harlan Ellison is such a famous asshole at cons that it was the plot of a Hardy Boys novel, but he still seems liked. At least, I like him. But he's a good writer and an equal opportunity offender and not, I think, a flaming bigot.<br>
I first heard of Vox Day through anti-Men's Rights and GamerGate blogs. I know him as a culture warrior first and a writer second, if it all.<br>
As Phil Sandifer said, no other community would be welcoming to people with his views. His hatred of women and racial and sexual minorities has no place in a civilized society. But it's found a home in fandom.<br>
Why?<br>
Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream skewers some Sci-fi as literal facist power fantasy, and it stings.

<br>
So? The escalators are not somehow absolved of responsibility for their escalation.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, neither they nor you have provided anything remotely resembling evidence that the "first step" (whatever the hell that supposedly was) was ideologically driven in the same way that SP/RP is - and they have flat out admitted the ideological motivations more than once in public and in writing.<br>
<br>
GRRM is very clearly talking about past cliques and campaigning in the context of "friends promoting friends because friends", no ideology necessary or in evidence.<br>
<br>
<em>So it's possible to not be bigoted and to still feel that there are some legitimate points, even if you think some of the stuff is a bridge too far.</em><br>
<br>
However, many people pushing the SP/RP slates have thoroughly and publicly established their bigotry, so that possibility is not relevant here, because that's not what's happening.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/145062" target="_self">soundguy99</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005677" target="_self">10:33 PM</a>  on April 11, 2015

<br>
I really hate it when one half of a sentence is pulled out of context, especially when that context involves a very particular situation in the thread and an explicit limiting clause. Doing so, IMO, is a dishonest shit move. <br>
<br>
To explain that further, the number of authors on my will-not-read (or listen to) list can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Correia and Butcher are not on that list yet. Wright, Day, and Card are because I think they've gone out of their way in public bigotry. I don't routinely do background checks on authors to figure out their political and religious affiliations. I'm not in the business of asking strangers their political voting habits, congregations, and party affiliations. Frankly, I don't know what any of the puppies look like, and wouldn't be able to identify them in a crowd or at a party anyway.<br>
<br>
Half of my family are Whovians, half of them are fundamentalist Christians (at least until my niece leaves the house). Talking about SF&amp;F helps bring us together in spite of politics. If I'm at a con or book talk, I want to talk about books. If we did start self-segregating on politics in those spaces, I'd likely be in a corner with my partner.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6005945" target="_self">8:50 AM</a>  on April 12, 2015

<br>
A significantly changed story becomes eligible again, though if it's also changed size, it moves to the appropriate category. There have been cases of winners being expanded to novels and being nominated again. <br>
<br>
Who decides if the change is significant enough to merit a new story? The Hugo Administrator for the year is the sole arbiter here. If they rule it's different enough, then it is and it is an eligible work. There's no appeal available if a Hugo Subcommittee is in place, as it is here (and always is) Theoretically, the entire concom could overrule if there wasn't, but *everybody* does the subcommittee to make sure nobody loses a nomination because they're on the concom. (Yes, it happens, esp. in Fanwriter/Fan Artist.) <br>
<br>
Historically, we've given a large bit of leeway to the authors on this point. Generally, if they say they've substantially reworked the story, we don't demand diffs from them as proof.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006127" target="_self">12:58 PM</a>  on April 12, 2015

Merely buying someone a membership does not disqualify votes -- if you buy a membership for you and your spouse, your spouse can vote. What you cannot do is vote both your and your spouse's memberships.

Sure.

I’m so sick of people actually enjoying books that are fun! Let’s shove more message fiction down their throats! My cause comes before their enjoyment! Diversity! Gay polar bears are being murdered by greedy corporations! Only smart people who think correct thoughts like I do should read books and I won’t be happy until my genre dies a horrible death!

<br>
Correira himself was <a href="http://monsterhunternation.com/2011/08/23/worldcon-report/?hc_location=ufie">rather enthusiastic about his first Worldcon</a> back in 2011 before he let his entitlement over run his common sense; so was his pal Turgidson. But even then the clues were there that they had a rather inflated opinion of themselves, seeing as how much both talk about not winning any Hugo or Campbell awards. <br>
<br>
 This idea that Worldcon or the Hugo Awards were just mean against decent, honest, hardworking writers like Turgidson or Laaarry is nonsense. Fandom has never not been welcoming to rightwing assholes, as long as they don't quite shit in the punch bowl.  People like David Weber, for all his clumsy attacks on liberals in the Honor Harrington books, has been massively popular for decades, while people like Tim Powers or Gene Wolfe have had masses of critical recognition too.<br>
<br>
But the problem is that Torgensen and Correira just aren't that good, nor all that popular, certainly not on the same level as Scalzi, who has gotten all the recognition and success they feel should be theirs. <br>
<br>
That drove them to their temper tantrum, that need for undeserved recognition, not anything fandom did.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006187" target="_self">2:13 PM</a>  on April 12, 2015

<br>
HPMoR doesn't qualify for either, as far as I can tell, it's not professionally published and both Best Novel and BRW are for professionally published works. If was was professionally published, that wouldn't apply, and I think it fits Novel more than BRW. <br>
<br>
Arguably, it does (and this is going to sound insulting, and I do not mean it to) qualify for BDP-L. BDP is, quite deliberately, a very wide category. Screenplays are BDP, not Best Novel/Novellette. <br>
<br>
It certainly has qualified the author for Best Fanwriter, and would have qualified the artist for Best Fanartist for the cover (if he was paid for that, then Best Artist) in the year the work was created, assuming I'm correct about the lack of professional publication. <br>
<br>
He is correct that *next* year would be the correct year to nominate it if it finishes this year. It would be treated as a serialized work, those become eligible when they are complete. Multi-part works have each part eligible upon release. And, yes, arguably, if that happens, the whole series is then ineligible as a series, but It's Complicated.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006206" target="_self">2:48 PM</a>  on April 12, 2015

My test for a category is that I want to see five works that are worthy of winning but that wouldn't make the ballot because there are five better works. That is, if you don't have 10 honestly worthy works every year, that category is problematic. <br>
<br>
Yes, this means I believe we need to collapse the written categories down to at least three. This will happen, basically, never, but hey, you have to stand for something. <br>

I'd almost rather have a Best Other Thing category for something you think is Hugo Worthy but doesn't fit a category. Bonus: It will torture the Hugo Administrators.

To bring in another thread about authorial embarrassment, I am having hardcore Catholic <em>fremdscham</em> on JCW's behalf after reading these. He's making Catholicism, and himself, look ridiculously shallow and facile, but doesn't even have the wit to be embarrassed by how superficial and simplistic this comes across. I am in a full-body cringe on his behalf. These sound like an 18-year-old fundamentalist Catholic with wealthy parents who's working hard to flunk out of freshman philosophy class in his effort to stick it to his "cafeteria Catholic" philosophy professor who, he believes, is nowhere near as smart as he is. He's just sitting there in his smug, entitled certainty while everyone laughs behind their hands at him. <em>And he doesn't realize it.</em> Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, I cannot read any more of this. It's not just bad, it is causing me emotional pain that he thinks it's not just good writing but <em>morally superior</em> writing!

<br>
Wright was your basic Libertarian Atheist Asshole - until he had a heart attack. The near-death experience apparently gave him a 'Road to Damascus' conversion experience: he came out of it leaving his 'Atheist Asshole' persona entirely behind, and has newly constructed for himself one of the basic 'New-Convert/Zealot Asshole' personas.  He's spent the last decade or a so being a walking advertisement for everything that's wrong with religion. (...Because HE has The Truth....)<br>
<br>
Reading his recent comments: yes, he sounds genuinely unhinged, delusional, insane.<br>
<br>
Which reminds me that <i>Beale's</i> daddy went fully and publicly delusional: while up on federal felony charges, Beale Senior convened a Pretend Court and issued Pretend Writs and Pretend Warrants to the Quite Real federal judge who was trying him.  Literally, crazy stuff. <br>
<br>
It bought him extra time in the pen for threatening a judge.  <br>
<br>
So, judging by the insane world-view he's constructed for himself, I've long wondered if Beale was also mentally ill, suffering from some sort of hereditary delusional condition.  It explains a lot.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18435" target="_self">AsYouKnow Bob</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006512" target="_self">7:10 PM</a>  on April 12, 2015

I think Leviathan Wakes is my least favorite in the Expanse series and it really does get a lot better once it's not narrated exclusively through the perspective of Miller and Holden, and there's a lot of expository worldbuilding that has to happen to set everything up. So it depends on what parts are confusing and weird, I guess? There are still multiple narrating characters, most of which have a significant amount of secondary characters that are important to their stories, so if it's keeping track of people, that'll still be hard, but that's the case with D&amp;C too.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/84904" target="_self">NoraReed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006883" target="_self">5:37 AM</a>  on April 13, 2015

		<a name="6006890"></a><div class="comments">Thankyou everyone who has been recommending good books in this thread. I'm one of the people who relies on Hugo nominations and winners for trying new-to-me authors, so it's good to have MeFi to fall back on when there's too much drama.<br>
<br>
What I've learned about the Hugos so far: <br>
<br>
Firstly, it's a popularity contest for the Worldcon group. There are other awards for merit, ideology, media format, etc but this one is essentially about which authors are the most popular with a dedicated but middle-of-the-road (broad?) audience. This is why friends vote for friends, why (like the Oscars, e.g. Gangs of New York, Return of the King) there are sometimes "belated" awards for an author who did excellent work a few years ago but missed out for some reason but has a new story out now so it's getting the love. This is the kind of thing that always happens with popularity contests, it's the nature of the beast. <br>
<br>
And secondly, there have always been right-wing authors nominated and winning this popularity contest, as shown by GRRM's breakdown. In fact, those conservative authors are not merely <em>included</em> in the convention and awards, but <em>liked</em> and <em>respected</em> by the fans.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, previous cabals and attempts to force a nominees list have been roundly condemned. There is self-promotion, there's promoting your friends, and then there's blatant pushing against the wishes of the fans. The latter is only prohibited by an unwritten rule which has generally been respected.<br>
<br>
So to take the ideology out of it just for a moment, I want to compare the Sad/Rabid Puppies authors who have been nominated but lost or not nominated (Torgeson, Correia, JCW, etc) only with the other conservative nominees and winners (Wolfe, Weber, Powers, some Heinlein).<br>
<br>
Conspiracy theories are constructed by people who don't want to face a difficult truth. It seems to me that if these guys aren't winning when other conservatives have, there are 3 plausible reasons.<br>
1. Their work is not of the same quality as the other conservative writers, it's just not Hugo-worthy.<br>
2. Their quality is fine, but their style or content is too specific for a mainstream SFF audience.<br>
3. Their quality, style and content are a good fit for the awards, but they are not as likeable or respected as the other conservative authors.<br>
<br>
So then that leaves 3 options for getting awards:<br>
a. Admit that their work is not as good as it could be, and work on improving their writing skills.<br>
b. Look for validation from other awards or ways of demonstrating approval (sales? fans at signings?) which are available to non-mainstream stories.<br>
c. Look deep into their hearts and see if there's a reason people like other conservative authors more. Maybe that's being less of a douchebag, but maybe it's about doing more social/online stuff so that you can build a fan base and become more popular generally.<br>
<br>
Note that there is no option d: Force everyone to vote for you by exploiting the nominations process.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/76925" target="_self">harriet vane</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006890" target="_self">5:55 AM</a>  on April 13, 2015

		<a name="6006892"></a><div class="comments">Martin writes an <a href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/420090.html">epic reply</a> to Larry Correia's already <a href="http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/04/09/a-response-to-george-r-r-martin-from-the-author-who-started-sad-puppies/">lengthy response</a> to Martin's earlier posts.  <br>
<br>
Here's some of my favorite bits.<br>
<br>
First, discussing last year's response to Sad Puppies 2:
<blockquote>I think that once again you are paraphrasing and turning the insult dial up to eleven. I will agree that there was a backlash. Permit me to suggest that much of the negative press you got derived from the fact that one of the stories you placed on the ballot was that novelette by Vox Day, who was already infamous by that point because of his attack on Nora Jemison, his run for SFWA president, and his expulsion from that organization. Here we are back again to the "lumping together" we discussed earlier. Had Vox Day not been on your ticket, I suspect the backlash would not have been a tenth as vociferous as it was. Imagine, for example, that there had been a "SJW" slate the same year, and that they had gotten half a dozen stories on the ballot, but one of those had been by Requires Hate? (Actually, of course, Hate was nominated for the Campbell, but under a pseudonym). The lashback would have been just as nasty. In your case, it did not help that the Day story was terrible. Your public platform was all about restoring "quality" to the Hugos, and yet one of your standard bearers was the worst piece of writing on the ballot. (In my opinion, of course. All of this is opinion).</blockquote>

And here, with the bit in brackets from Correia:
<blockquote>[[...Unlike the existing cliques, Sad Puppies 3 didn’t give a damn about politics, race, religion, or orientation. All we cared about was could they tell us a damned good story.]] <br>
<br>
Got it. Politics, race, religion, and sexual orientation, OUT. Damned good stories, IN. And for this year's Damned Good Story standard bearer, you chose... John C. Wright SIX TIMES!!! John C. Wright, a writer famed far and wide for having no opinions on politics, race, religion, or sexual orientation, and would never dream of injecting such messages into his Damned Good Stories. Because, after all, the Puppies get sad when they are made to read Message Fiction.<br>
<br>
So Wright is in, and who is out? James S.A. Corey. Emily St. John Mandel. John Scalzi (of course). THREE BODY PROBLEM. Joe Abercrombie. Larry Niven. Greg Bear. Daniel Abraham. John Varley. William Gibson. Joe Haldeman. Greg Benford. Lev Grossman. Stephen King. No damned good stories there. I guess. No real science fiction, no exciting fantasy, nothing entertaining or commercial, just pretentious left-wing literary crap, right?</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73881" target="_self">overglow</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6006892" target="_self">6:10 AM</a>  on April 13, 2015

The second spaceship with weird stuff happening (if I recall the order these things  are in correctly, it's been a while and it was on audiobook) was by way of introducing you to some main characters. Also, unless I really, really missed something there's nothing there that is set a few centuries ago, unless there was a short scene with some really heavy foreshadowing that I forgot. The unintelligible accent doesn't show up much and actually almost never after that investigation scene (if memory serves), which is there to introduce you to the cop. And it is absolutely worth pushing through, because they are, ultimately, very well-crafted, carefully built and written fun.<br>
<br>
(Also, one of the future books introduces one of my favorite female characters ever.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/181963" target="_self">seyirci</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6007010" target="_self">9:07 AM</a>  on April 13, 2015

		<a name="6007683"></a><div class="comments">Thinking about it more, I'm actually having a lot of complicated thoughts about the generational and cultural differences between fans and how they are affecting this brouhaha. And I think some of it is broken down into old and new, but I think it's really important to note that not everyone is receiving the same generations at the same time - not everyone of an age is Of An Age, as it were. In particular, with books that have been created for about a century, and from parent to child it's pretty easy to get far astray.<br>
<br>
When I first read science fiction, I primarily read 'old' science fiction. Cheap used books that made their way to me or to my house - the oldest and most popular. I read books like "Starship Troopers" and "Foundation" and "The Lord of the Rings" and "John Carter of Mars" and "Soldier, Ask Not" even though all were published decades before I was born. When I started reading 'newer' fantasy, even that was just stuff new enough to be published about the time I was born. And to me, as I suspect is the case for others, the Real, Great Science Fiction/Fantasy, to me, has always been at least structurally similar to the stuff I grew up reading - my first taste of Nutty Nuggets, if you will, but really just because the things you loved as a teenager, that time period when you love everything intensely, are always going to be special to you.<br>
<br>
This is categorically true regardless of belief - look at the rise of 'nostalgia' movies, games, and marketing. Look at how we all, as humans, react when we think of the music of when we were young, the movies we loved. As others have noted, some of these don't stand a revisit, but our memories of them are always they strongest. We loved things back then the hardest.<br>
<br>
And so for me, I will admit that my One True Science Fiction has always been unironic stories about men conquering the stars and finding freedom there - the Golden Age being talked about by Torg and Correia - even though I am not, by age, of the generation that was expected to be reading that. I didn't have disposable income, or Kindle self-published options. What I read was used books or what people lent me. And when I got into Fandom - hey, everyone knew those stories and could talk about those stories competently! You can go a long way in Fandom on old stories, and people do - or did, when I entered Fandom - tend not to thumb their nose at the Greats. <br>
<br>
But at the same time, in a parallel universe, people my age were maybe getting science fiction from libraries with sharp librarians buying modern SF, or from what was new and hot in bookstores. Some of those stories probably involved criticism of race. A lot of the stories now may have those criticisms of race. I am culturally disconnected from my fan generation. I am a gray fanhead in a youngish body. Though I buy my books now on Amazon, when Amazon recommends things, it recommends me things based on what I've already read. I do not see the SF world they see, unless people from that world recommend things to me.<br>
<br>
So when people say that it's completely implausible that this is the kind of stuff that Torg and Correia were reading and seeing as the One True SF - well, I'm a walking example of how that might not be the case.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6007683" target="_self">3:49 PM</a>  on April 13, 2015

<br>
I see what you're getting at, but -- I hope you'll take my word for it that I don't mean this judgmentally; what I read as a teen was also very "classics"-heavy though light on Heinlein -- that only clarifies that the nature of their error about what SF was like back In The Good Old Days was plausibly sincere.

C'mon...) , and all it does is change the puppies from being malicious and purposefully wrong to being malicious and uninformed. So I don't buy that as an attempt to excuse their rabidly reactionary behavior and associations. Hell, as others have pointed out, Big Names like Heinlein and Asimov and Clarke (just to name a few) all dealt with social justice issues and playing with the existing tropes in SFF before these knuckleheads were even born. So maaaaybe if they were stuck in a backwater, barely-out-of-Jim-Crow locale, they might not have been exposed to a LeGuin or Delany, or <em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em> would have been banned by local prudes. Still, even if I grant them all of what you claim, it just makes what they have done <em>worse</em>, not better. The responses from people like GRRM, Scalzi, Jemisin, and others have proven IMO beyond a shadow of a doubt that they're just parroting the same discriminatory, bullying behavior of horrible people in society at large. Not to mention the fact that there's all of the other horrible stuff like Torgersen's "boys will be boys" handwaving about VD, or Correia's admiration for GG and their tactics. In the end, their theory on "what SFF used to be" was debunked by the SFF community at large long before they engaged in their shitty crusade. We've already gone over it in this thread, and so thoroughly that it's pretty sad that it's still being trotted out to explain away their horrible behavior.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6007774" target="_self">4:34 PM</a>  on April 13, 2015

Corb, the New Wave began in the 60s, which happened 50 years ago. Michael Moorcock was skewering heroic fantasy with an albino antihero decades before I was born. Look up Ursula K LeGuin and the dates of publication of Earthsea and tell me if she's a young interloper. <br>

		<a name="6007840"></a><div class="comments">I also grew up on "classic" science fiction. My dad was in the Science Fiction Book Club when he was in high school in the early 1960s, and I plowed my way through Asimov, Heinlein, and Clifford Simak (am I the first person to mention him here?) starting in late elementary school.  I loved Susan Calvin, and tried my hand at writing my own robot stories.  But I really really loved Simak.  <br>
<br>
<i>They Walked Like Men</i>, like all body-snatcher books, has some obvious political overtones that I got when I was 13.  But I really really loved (and still do) <i>Way Station</i>.  It is the story of a veteran of the US Civil War who was recruited to run a way station on earth for traveling extra-terrestrials, in exchange for immortality.  He provides food and rest for them and has conversations with them about the universe, but he obviously must isolate himself from his own species to do so.  Again, the political implications to this story were obvious to me in junior high.<br>
<br>
Then, my brother joined the Science Fiction Book Club himself, and suddenly there were new books in our house.  Some were by the same authors of our childhood, (including <i>Friday</i>, which is still my favorite Heinlein (shutup haters)), but there were also great new things from folks like Greg Bear and Harlan Ellison and of course the beautiful <i>Good Omens</i> which introduced me to Gaiman and Pratchett.  The world was getting bigger and more interesting.  Women besides Susan Calvin could be central characters in stories.  New stories were being told.<br>
<br>
And then I became an adult.  And I discovered Octavia Butler and Margaret Atwood and Connie Willis and now Scalzi and N.K. Jemisin and Sofia Samatar and Elizabeth Bear and brand new voices like my friend Monica Byrne, who just won the Tiptree for her astonishing <i>The Girl in the Road</i>.  And I discovered John Brunner, who my dad had somehow completely missed and who to me is the most amazing "classic" science fiction of all because all of his speculation was right (except the thing about merkins).  And I still love <i>Caves of Steel</i> and <i>Way Station</i> and I even still love <i>Starship Troopers</i>, but there keeps being new, exciting stuff that keeps the speculative and science in science fiction.  And that's just amazing and I love it, and why would I want to give that up when I can keep reading the classic old stuff and also keep reading new stuff that keeps inspiring and exciting me?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18786" target="_self">hydropsyche</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6007840" target="_self">5:18 PM</a>  on April 13, 2015

I feel like that was probably the instructor's personal preferences winning out, but we'll see... there's honestly so much to choose from in each decade that this same course taught by another instructor with free reign of book choice would likely be mega different.

		<a name="6007996"></a><div class="comments">I'm somewhat older than Larry Correia (HOW DID THAT HAPPEN I AM STILL YOUNG AND SPRIGHTLY DAMMIT), and am a second generation science fiction fan.  And I read a lot.  Like, really a lot.  Always did and still do.<br>
<br>
My introduction to the genre was "stuff from my parents' massive collection".  Some of the writers I cut my teeth on were putting out classic work as early as the 30's -- Campbell, Weinbaum, del Rey.<br>
<br>
A lot of them were certainly doing so by the 40's -- Sturgeon, Heinlein, Asimov, Kuttner, Moore, Clement, de Camp, Bradbury, Lem, Brown, van Vogt, Brackett, Merrill, Schmitz, Cordwainer Smith, Clarke, Bester.  The 50's?  Add in Kornbluth, Blish, Pohl, Norton, Anderson, Knight, Vance.<br>
<br>
I mean, sure, I was reading later stuff, too, at the same time.  Zelazny was a favorite -- and so was Le Guin, and Tiptree, and Powers, and Cherryh.  I read Brunner, Dickson, Harrison, Ellison, Silverberg, Laumer, White, Farmer, Wilhelm, Herbert, McCaffrey, Niven, Lee, Vinge, the other Vinge, Varley, Russ, Brin, Martin, McIntyre, Morrow.  (And yes, there were some I loved then but the authors or the works are troubling to me now -- Card, Bradley, and Anthony, among others.)<br>
<br>
And I'm forgetting so many!  And I haven't even started on Fantasy -- de Camp and Pratt!  Collier!  Lieber!  Tolkien!  Alexander!  Hodgell!  Lewis!  McKillip!  McKinley!  Moorcock!  Kurtz!  AND I HAVEN'T EVEN HIT ADOLESCENCE YET!<br>
<br>
Now ... some of it holds up better to me than others.  Some is still great.  Some I outgrew.  Some I didn't get at the time and had to grow into.  Some of it I can see flaws now that I couldn't then.  Some flaws I can excuse.  Some I can't.  Some writers got better over time, some got worse, some had a peak somewhere in the middle.<br>
<br>
But this is definitely, DEFINITELY, the stuff I grew up loving, too.<br>
<br>
The Puppies' arguments do not hold up for me.<br>
<br>
I see no conspiracy against old-school adventure stories in recent years.  In fact, I see a lot of adventure stories winning the Hugos.<br>
<br>
I see no conspiracy against conservative authors or works in recent years.  Brandon Sanderson gets nominations and has taken home a couple of Hugos.  I think Dan Wells has one for something.  (Both of them authors I've read; in fact, I have a fat shelf of Sanderson, sitting comfortably nearby likely political opposites like Scalzi, Sandler, and Ryman.)<br>
<br>
I do believe that authors who are well-liked in fandom and have prominent blogs get more Hugo nominations than authors who don't.  That's not ideal, but also not a conspiracy.<br>
<br>
I do believe a lot of (but by no means all) science fiction fans have liberal leanings and may like books that resonate with their opinions more than ones that don't.  That's not a conspiracy either.<br>
<br>
And I think most will give a fair shake to authors with opinions we disagree with.  OK, for myself, yes I have limits on that.  I'm reluctant to give my money to Orson Scott Card now.  Or Dave Sim.  Or Vox Day.  But they are, you know, pretty damn extreme.  I was fine with the Brin book where the villain was a radical environmentalist.  And atheist, socialist me loved Declare, by Powers.<br>
<br>
I do believe that there is a vocal portion of fandom that lights up with happiness when a good book comes out that acknowledges that more people exist than straight white men.  Heck, I'm one of them, as my lists of books earlier in the thread probably indicates.  (And I left Ellen Kushner off of it, gah, what was I thinking!)  But that doesn't mean our brains fall out when we do.  There are a whole bunch of books I left off those lists because I didn't think they were good enough to recommend.  Others I waffled on before putting them on (Jane Fletcher pushes my specific buttons, but I'll readily admit she's a hit or miss author.)<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my final disagreement with the Puppies.  I do not think they are presenting us with unfairly kept down gems.  Because I've been reading the stuff they put on their slate and an awful lot of it is shite.  It reads like ... well, like stuff selected by someone so blinded by ideology that their brains fell out.  And then voted on by people who didn't bother to read what they were voting for.  Which I think is what happened.<br>
<br>
Which is why I don't like the idea of a slate of any kind.  But this slate in particular?<br>
<br>
Is an insult to all those authors they claim to admire.  All those authors I grew up loving, too.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6007996" target="_self">8:08 PM</a>  on April 13, 2015

Yet for as much as Torgersen,  Correia, and Day dump out words by the bucketful in response to criticism of the puppies, I still haven't seen them grapple with the accusation that <em>hey, these books are really, really lousy</em>. And I don't mean just claiming over and over that they're fun adventures, as if saying it will make it true. I mean actually acknowledging that people find these works to be crappy storytelling, and refuting with arguments why they're not.<br>

It's part of the white nationalist strategy that Leonard Zeskind in his book <em>Blood and Politics</em> (a definitive account of white nationalism) called "mainstreaming," trying to tack white nationalist beliefs into an existing reactionary right wing framework.

Sasquan is running basically 50/50 supporting/attending. It's setting up to be a very small Worldcon, in terms of who's actually there, but may be the largest US Worldcon ever, in terms of total members, and may even catch Loncon 3. <br>

Beale's Rabid Puppies slate featured himself twice and beyond that <i>things published by his own company 7 times.</i> (Sad Puppies' slate featured 3 Castalia House stories.)<br>

		<a name="6008286"></a><div class="comments">From the John C. Wright link Eyebrows McGee just posted: "... [T]he numbers speak for themselves. We can take the Amazon rankings of books as a rough measure of the popularity of a work ... The numbers prove objectively that our suggested slate better represents the tastes of the SF public."<br>
<br>
I just ...<br>
<br>
1) Wow, the ginormous 0.27 difference in Amazon ratings between the Puppy novel picks and the Non-Puppy novel picks this year really convinces me that your the Puppy choices are much better regarded by all!<br>
<br>
2) It's even more impressive when you realize that most of that difference comes from the fact that they slipped book 15 of a series onto their slate.  I'm sure tons of people who hate the series stuck around to review book 15!<br>
<br>
3) But sure, yeah, Amazon reviews are no doubt the best way to make these decisions.  I'm going to call up science fiction on Amazon and sort by average customer review to see what the Hugo slate SHOULD have been this year!  Here are the first five that come up with 2014 publication dates:<br>
<br>
Transmission: V Plague Book 5 -- "With the virus mutating, new dangers appear that threaten a bloody end to the struggle for survival.  With Rachel still missing, it's up to Major Chase to rescue her and reaffirm the alliance to bring down the Russian president."<br>
<br>
Rise of the Alliance (The Frontiers Saga) (Volume 12) -- "Things finally seem to be coming together for Captain Scott and the Alliance, as he takes his forces on the offensive. However, the Jung may in turn give him more trouble than he bargained for."<br>
<br>
The Fires of Atlantis (Purge of Babylon) (Volume 4) -- "The survivors’ radio broadcast has elicited surprising responses from around the globe. It might be the start of a resistance against the ghoul domination … if Lara can keep everyone alive long enough."<br>
<br>
Slow Burn: Bleed, Book 6 -- "Zed and Murphy are trying to find their surviving friends to finally get out of Austin and head west to safety, away from the zombie hordes. But trouble, their perpetual companion, dogs them at every turn as they discover that infected humans aren’t the only source of mortal danger."<br>
<br>
Zombie Fallout 8: An Old Beginning -- "Mike and his family escaped a vast zombie horde to find themselves imprisoned by a clandestine group that seeks global domination by the most nefarious means possible. Help is coming, in the form of a 500-year-old PopTart-loving vampire named Tommy."<br>
<br>
So there you go.  These books were ROBBED.  I am shocked that the Puppies dared to nominate The Dark Between the Stars, with a mere 4.4 rating (from a piddly 52 reviews), when Transmission: V Plague Book 5 has a 4.9 with more than twice that many reviewers!  What of Transmission: V Plague Book 5, Sad Puppies?

Vox Day is a fucking idiot. I mean, not just because I disagree with everything he says, but because he is actually stupid and fails at basic comprehension of things he is saying and doing.<br>
<br>
In 1966, <em>Dune</em> beat <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em> and won the Hugo for Best Novel. In 1967, <em>Moon</em> won the award. Because there are different rules for a serialized novel, than for a short story appearing for the first time in an anthology. A serialized novel can be eligible when it is serialized, and again when it is published as a standalone novel. It actually applied to both Herbert and Heinlein in this case, since both novels had been serialized and both won their award in the last year that they were eligible. This is important, because a novel that is serialized may get much wider attention when it is published in book form. Certainly this was the case with <em>Old Man's War</em>.

No, it's because <strong>you</strong> keep bringing him up! It isn't coincidence, it's your weird obsession with Scalzi.<br>

And also, the other Wright story which had been published earlier and was republished in 2014 was in fact eligible! Why is there one rule for approved SJWs like JCW and one for puppies like JCW? Unfair!<br>

It very well might, however, fall under the "substantial change" rule -- e.g. why two different versions of Dune were nominated for best novel, once in 1964 and once in 1966.<br>
<br>
If there were substantial differences between the serialized version of Old Man's War that appeared on the website and the published version, it was completely fair game to nominate -- Just as Kratman's Big Boys Don’t Cry and Wright's One Bright Star to Guide Them are still on the ballot, despite appearing before; they were judged to have changed enough.<br>
<br>
If the serialized version of Old Man's War and the published book are mostly identical, then in fact I would probably agree its being on the ballot was a mistake and it shouldn't have been eligible.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6008392" target="_self">9:07 AM</a>  on April 14, 2015

I don't have fair copies of the 2002 and 2005 texts of the work to be able to judge myself.<br>
<br>
I will note the only reason it made the ballot was that Neil Gaiman pulled his nomination for <i>Anasasi Boys</i>, allowing OMW to slip in to the final slot, just ahead of Dan Simmons <i>Olympos</i>, but if you want to see how close it can be, the orginal 4-7 slots had 47, 46, 45 and 44 nominations.<br>
<br>
The other four that year? Charlie Stross, <i>Accelerando</i>, Ken MacLeod, <i>Learning The World</i>, George R. R. Martin, <i>A Feast For Crows</i> and the winner, Robert Charles Wilson, <i>Spin</i>.<br>
<br>
Scalzi, Stross, and GRRM. It's practically a thread replay. I suspect both Stross and MacLeod did well in 2006 thanks to 2005 nominators, the 2005 Worldcon was in Glasgow. I know why RCW won -- <i>Spin</i> was an amazing book, and it won in a walk. (Last place? GRRM!) <br>
<br>
Scalzi did win the Campbell that year. That was also the year I first met Scalzi, Cory Doctorow introduced me to him, and when Cory gave me an early copy of what would become <i>Little Brother</i>, Scalzi said "Sign that, dude, if you become famous, that's *bank* for him!" <br>

<br>
That was, at one time, literally true, but is not long true. A serialized work is eligible when completed, and yes, we have trouble with things like "A Wheel of Time" which was both a number of eligible independent works and arguably a single serialized work. See also "The Lord of The Rings", "The Baroque Cycle", and for future consideration, "A Song of Ice and Fire." <br>
<br>
But once a given work is nominated as a serial, it can't just be collected into a single work and become eligible again. If the text of the 2005 Novel <i>Old Man's War</i> was substantially the same as the 2002 serial "Old Man's War", then VD is correct, that work was not eligible. <br>
<br>
I suspect, thanks to the edit process, it was very different, and given that it didn't win, I'm not too worried about it. Scalzi himself is currently recovering from traveling back from Australia and a leg injury received there, and has made it known that while he has comments about everything, he's basically on hold until he actually gets home and settled, because there are far more important things than the Hugos, like the dog, the cats, the house, the ukuleles, and most importantly, his daughter and wife. They come first, the rest of the list is 2nd and the Hugos are *way* behind that list, as are things like Whatever, MeFi, or anything else on the Internet. <br>
<br>
As, of course, it should be. Because say what you will about Mefi's Own jscalzi, this is a man who knows what's important in life, and while that shiny rocket award is rather cool, it has nothing on his family.<br>
<br>
Yes, we have discussed, briefly, a "Best Serial Work" Hugo, and it quickly fails the basic test -- can you show me at least 5 (and I personally demand 10) worthy nominees every year for the last few years?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6008439" target="_self">10:03 AM</a>  on April 14, 2015

<br>
Voting in Site Selection is <b>not</b> free. It's $40 US, SAIT. The result of this payment, however, is that you become a supporting member of whomever wins the 2017 Worldcon. This will enable you to:<br>
<br>
1) Nominate in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Hugo Awards.<br>
2) Vote in the 2017 Hugo Awards final ballot.<br>
3) Vote in the 2019 Worldcon Site Selection.<br>
4) (tentative) Approve constitutional amendments ratified by the 2016 business meeting (assuming 2+1 ratifies this year.)<br>
5) Receive all publications of the 2017 Worldcon.<br>
6) And, for the first 90 days after the vote, be allowed to covert your supporting membership to an attending membership for the absolute lowest rate possible. <br>
<br>
If you don't care, you may vote No Preference. This means you don't care, and you become a supporting member of the winner. If you are a bot, the rules require you to vote No Preference, but you are still welcome to join! If you hate all the choices, you may vote "None of the Above." Should that win, the 2015 Business Meeting will be required to decide what to do about the 2017 Worldcon. Heh. I recommend voting NotA first just to scare them. You can also write in a vote, but that candidate is required to file paperwork certifying a valid site for the Worldcon before the close of voting. <br>
<br>
Voting is by Single Transferable Vote, just like the Hugo Vote, simplest way is to rank the sites you feel are acceptable in order, then "NotA", then if you care to, rank the rest. However, do *not* rank No Preference if you have still have preferences, because the moment No Preference is ranked higher than anybody who hasn't been eliminated, your ballot becomes NP and is set aside as such.<br>
<br>
Site Selection is by <a href="http://dc17.org/assets/final-final-final-75th-worldcon-site-selection-ballot.pdf">paper ballot</a> (ht to DC17 for the online copy) or by emailing a filled out copy of the pdf as a pdf. There's no direct online voting (there needs to be a strong audit trail, because we need to present a stack of money and a list of members to the winner.) You may pay the $40 online, apparently, but that's not up yet, as far as I can tell. Just send a check, I know, it's retro, or wait for the payment. Apparently, you'll get a token number, you can then fill that in. They promise to *try* to keep your secret ballot secret, but when they go to print it out, someone might see it. <br>
<br>
Our four (!) bidders, in order of filing, because that's how Sasquan has them listed:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://dc17.org">DC in 17 (Washington, DC, USA, Aug 16-20)</a><br>
<a href="http://nippon2017.org">Nippon in 2017 (Shizuoka City, Japan, Aug 24-28)</a><a><br>

<a href="http://www.helsinkiin2017.org">Helsinki in 2017 (Helsinki, Finland, Aug 9-13)</a> <br>
<br>
Historically, DC has seen two prior Worldcons, Discon ('63) and Discon II ('74) as well as the nearby ConStellation ('83) and BucConneer ('98), both in Baltimore, MD. <br>
<br>
Japan has had only one, Nippon2007 in, well, 2007, in Yokohama.<br>
<br>
Montreal has also had one, Anticipation, in 2009.<br>
<br>
Helsinki has not yet hosted. They last bid two years ago, losing in a three way race between the Orlando, Helsinki and Spokane bids, the winner is this year's convention, Sasquan.<br>
<br>
For those wanting more details of the bids, you have the bidsite links above, and Sasquan has published copies of the bid's filed paperwork on their <a href="http://sasquan.org/site-selection/">site selection page</a>. <br>

Now back to your regularly scheduled Hugo turmoil. <br>

If anybody still doubts that Correia has gone full 'gator, notice how all his rant is missing is an MSPaint picture with red arrows linking Worldcon to DIGRA. I especially love how he uses the sealioning comic in the exact opposite of what it actually means. Oh, and how he can't actually pinpoint any of the Worldcon '11 nastiness he alleged, which as far as I've been able to determine isn't backed up by <strong>any</strong> of the accounts of his fellow panel members or attendees. I would assume at least Dan Wells would have backed him up, but his roundup of the con (and everyone else's) says basically the same thing Correia's original glowing report does.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6008514" target="_self">11:00 AM</a>  on April 14, 2015

<br>
If there really was two sets of rules, one for regular people and one for rampaging assholes actively seeking to damage the awards, I would be very okay with that. Even though this is just the people pushing the limits of the rules getting extra scrutiny, and Day is smart enough to know that.<br>
<br>
Drinky Die: I'm surprised by how strong my reaction is, too. I think for me it's that for years I've used Hugo nominees and winners to guide what I read. By now, I'm well-connected enough to fandom to find good stuff even if the Hugos turn to crap. But the me of 10 years ago wasn't, and I want the new fans of today to have meaningful Hugos.

		<a name="6008895"></a><div class="comments">So, after my initial outrage at just how bad some of the Puppy nominations are ... I'm personally going to let that aspect drop.<br>
<br>
There are people on the Puppy side who believe that Ancillary Justice is terrible, no one really liked it and it won with an "affirmative action" vote.<br>
<br>
Do I think that makes them crazy people from the crazy planet?  Yes.<br>
<br>
Do I think they are right that the people who voted for it did not really like it?  No.<br>
<br>
Do I think they believe that Ancillary Justice is terrible?  Well ... I mean ... That's their opinion.  It is LITERALLY their opinion.  I cannot tell them, no, you actually did like it.<br>
<br>
But the flip side of that is they really should be willing to believe I ACTUALLY did like it if I say I did.  One of my resentments in this is that they keep saying I don't.<br>
<br>
And that works both ways.  If they say they love, I don't know, "Burly Man-Man and His Space Harem", they think it is the best book ever, well.  OK.  I kind of have to take their word for it.<br>
<br>
If a majority of Hugo voters pick "Burly Man-Man and His Space Harem" for best novel because they love it, well ... that's how a fan vote works, I guess.<br>
<br>
My real objection is to a slate.<br>
<br>
A nomination slate allowed a minority of voters, through a quirk of the rules, to hijack the process and shut out works the majority would have preferred.<br>
<br>
A slate encouraged voters to vote for many things they have not read and/or are not familiar with, which I believe is contrary to the spirit of the nominations, and I think there is significant evidence that this happened this year.<br>
<br>
But I'm not going to argue that the slate let in works that are "bad".  I will take people's word that someone, somewhere likes them.  And the separate issue of whether or not I like them is not really a concern in how I'm going to vote, because I am voting against the slate concept.<br>
<br>
That probably will make them lump me in with exactly the kind of people they rail about.  "See, here is someone who admits they are not judging all the Hugo nominees on their merits!"  But they'd be wrong about why.  It isn't about their ideology, or the ideology of their choices.  It's because I think what they did was fundamentally undemocratic and wrong.<br>
<br>
"Within the rules", sure, but wrong.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6008895" target="_self">2:11 PM</a>  on April 14, 2015

I think the two are slightly different questions. I like a lot of books; I don't think they're all excellent, best of the year. And although I don't always like books that are often thought of as good books, I can usually see what qualities they have that other people like.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6008925" target="_self">2:24 PM</a>  on April 14, 2015

		<a name="6008979"></a><div class="comments"><blockquote>I don't really think OMW did something weird or wrong or that Scalzi was at the time part of some fictional cabal to get himself nominated, I just don't entirely understand why his book was allowed and The Martian not. Maybe The Martian wasn't edited as thoroughly? Maybe it wasn't as clear then what to do with self-published stuff and the rules have been clarified since.</blockquote>

I think it's a combination of the two: self publishing hadn't quite taken off to the extent that the Hugos had to worry about it and publishing meant still being published by a proper publisher, while Kevin Standlee, Hugo rules lawyer extra ordinaire, <a href="http://file770.com/?p=21886&amp;cpage=1#comment-250862">thinks it was the revisions rule that it qualified under</a>. <br>
<br>
The Martian was said not to qualify by people who knew the Hugo rules inside and out, but hasn't been put to the test because it didn't gain enough nominations.
<blockquote>The one story I do remember being disqualified was actually by someone who would be considered part of the cabal, Mary Robinette Kowal's The Lady Astronaut of Mars. (It got on the next year's ballot and won. Presumably those two cancel each other out, cabal-wise.)</blockquote>

<br>
It's up for ratification this year, the motion title is, IIRC,  "A story is a story." <br>
<br>
<i>The Martian was said not to qualify by people who knew the Hugo rules inside and out, but hasn't been put to the test because it didn't gain enough nominations.</i><br>
<br>
Fundamentally, this is just a matter of people time. First you let nominations happen. You move mis-categorized works into the correct category, if possible, you then run the count. You check your first five, if you see no reason to doubt their eligibility, you call them up and see if they accept the nomination. If they do not, you move up however many are needed, test their eligibility, and call them. Once you have 5 accepted nominations, you stop, simply because this has cost you a bunch of time already, there are something like 14 more categories to do nowadays, you're not getting paid for this and you have a real life as well as this job. <br>
<br>
So, nobody blanket verifies eligibility, we only check if it needs to be checked.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009043" target="_self">3:40 PM</a>  on April 14, 2015

		<a name="6009049"></a><div class="comments">I think I started reading science fiction when I could pick out the book with the spaceship on the cover. (BTW, I have an undying soft spot for the V2-style rocket design that's used by the Hugo trophy.) And children's science fiction/fantasy that I encountered once I graduated to books without illustrations included such lovely optimistic pieces as:<br>
<br>
* John Christopher's Tripods (and other post-apocalyptic works of kids left alone)<br>
* Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising, which was dark and spooky modern fantasy<br>
* Le Guin's Earthsea, which was Lathe of Heaven for kids<br>
* Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydian, with that whole thing of stuffing people in cauldrons.<br>
* L'Engle's Time Quintet. <br>
<br>
I grew into Piers Anthony, who's just creepy in other ways, and Stephen King, who was the contemporary horror/fantasy god at the time. (I think King, Straub, and Barker had a big influence on urban fantasy of both mythopoetic and monster-hunter flavors.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009049" target="_self">3:42 PM</a>  on April 14, 2015

<br>
I hate to read into things too much, but I think Torgensen's position probably has more to do with alienation from his wartime service than with his actual generation. It's something I know well and have experienced personally - you come back from years of war, so you are actually culturally separated from the home you left behind, but also while you're away, you idealize everything about America, and there's no way the real thing can match up. There definitely can be a sense - there was for most guys I knew - that while they were away, the America they loved had been destroyed from within. It didn't even matter what their politics actually was. Left wing vets were convinced that all the police shootings were suddenly new and had never happened before they left, right wing vets were convinced that communism had taken a bite out of the heart of America while they were sleeping. Everyone missed the home they had built up for themselves to keep them sane; the mental image that focused upon America as another generation kept photos in their helmets. <br>
<br>
So maybe he started reading science fiction half a century old. Maybe he went to a couple cons and had a great time. And then he went away, and when he came back, everything looked like it was in flames - because the world he'd idealized hadn't existed for a long time.<br>
<br>
I also see a problem with booting authors or no-awarding them based on personal politics. But I don't think it's something that has just sprung up like magic in the last three years.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009192" target="_self">5:17 PM</a>  on April 14, 2015

		<a name="6009255"></a><div class="comments">It's not actually that complicated.  The people actively engaged in booting people because of personal politics are the sad and rabid puppies. We've seen the stats, we've seen the personal statements from the puppies engaged in the booting and we've seen the total absence of statements from the alleged SWJs who the puppies allege have been doing booting of their own. <br>
(In other words, cite or it didn't happen. "I think" and "I don't think" don't count.  In other other words, fish or cut bait.)<br>
<br>
As for not making the puppies feel welcome despite all their "angst" - it's really simple.  Basic primary-school playground politics, in fact:*<br>
There's a group of kids in the playground making a great big circle and inviting everyone to play with them. Wheeee! They like making friends!<br>
There's another group of kids who think all the other kids aren't as good as they are, and some of them even put their hands on their hips and yell that the other kids should be punished for the immoral scum that they are. Gosh, that's really mean!<br>
Now, if one of those mean superior kids walks up and punches a kid from the circle in the nose - and then another one, and then another one, the appropriate response is not for the circle to be kind to them and show them that they are still special.  <br>
What happens is that the kid in question gets a stiff time out and a lecture about how hitting people is not nice, and they are told that they will not be welcome back in the playground until they have agreed not to hit people. Or incidentally, say mean things to people who want everyone to come and play.  It doesn't matter if you are very sad or very lonely or don't think other people are as good as you are, you aren't allowed to punch other people in the face.  It's a learning experience - thou shalt not be an entitled and punchy little prick, and if you are, your recess privileges are taken away until you learn how to behave. And if you have been punched because you like to make lots and lots of friends, you have just had a lesson in how to stand up to bullies!<br>
Yay!  Everybody wins!<br>

Torgersen's "The Chaplain's Legacy" (a nominee last year courtesy of Sad Puppies 2) was a perfectly readable story. Correia's <i>Monster Hunter International</i> showed a genuine talent for action scenes. I found a lot of what wasn't action to be clunky, but hey -- good thing it was mostly action scenes.

I've seen people make horrendous mistakes. I've seen others rise to the challenge. I've seen this community raise thousands of dollars for good causes and thousands of pints of blood at conventions all over the nation. Fans are accepting and inclusive -- much more so than almost any other group I've ever been a part of. (Yeah, some fans are jerks -- but most fans are not.)<br>
<br>
But back to that old man thing -- I get invited to conventions as a guest and I enjoy going, but I'm well aware that I represent the past -- part of the tradition that the community is built on. All these new writers, people whose names I'm still learning, people whose works I'm still discovering -- they're the future of this community. And for the most part, it looks like a very exciting future. I hope I live long enough to see some of these new sparks mature into bright stars. I love what they're inventing.<br>
<br>
This year -- this stuff, this little turd in the punch bowl -- the community will survive it. Whatever happens, the Hugo will survive. With an asterisk, perhaps. (Maybe we'll hand out official asterisks with the trophies this year.) But the one thing that is growing more and more likely ... the architects of this squabble will have indelibly damaged themselves in the eyes of the SF community. There are invitations and acknowledgments that will never be offered -- not because it's a blacklist, but because nobody wants to hang out with assholes.<br>
<br>
And if that's "unpersoning," then it's self-inflicted.<br>
<br>
Whine all you want, Brad. It won't work. I learned it by the time I was five. I never got anything I wanted by whining -- so I stopped wasting energy and learned how to work for results the old-fashioned way.<br>
<br>
But then, what do I know about any of this? It's always the young turks who know better, right?<br>

		<a name="6009347"></a><div class="comments"><em>I hate to read into things too much, but I think Torgensen's position probably has more to do with alienation from his wartime service than with his actual generation. It's something I know well and have experienced personally - you come back from years of war, so you are actually culturally separated from the home you left behind, but also while you're away, you idealize everything about America, and there's no way the real thing can match up.</em><br>
<br>
I think you may be reading a lot into things, since <em><strong>Torgersen</strong></em> (c'mon, y'all, even if we disagree with him get the man's name right) has never been deployed, especially not overseas.  His Wikipedia page says he was a cook in the Navy and spent his time at Naval Station Mayport in Florida.  I suspect that's bullshit, though, since Torgersen is very open about his long-standing service in the Army Reserve (he joined shortly after 9/11), where he's now reached the rank of Warrant Officer.<br>
<br>
Torgersen's military record, in his own words:
<blockquote> Sept. 28, 2009: <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/they-call-me-mister-torgersen/"><em>"I’m just a 420A paper pusher. My role is to HELP the real fighters who run, jump, fly, and drive into the teeth of battle."</em></a><br>
<br>
Sept. 9, 2011: <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/9-11-ten-years-gone/"><em>"I am what’s called a Personnel Technician. I’m trained to know my way around the Army’s equivalent of HR. It’s not a glamorous nor macho job. But it’s portable, and it’s allowed me to do what I think I do best: help other soldiers get their jobs done without having to worry that their paperwork and records and other necessary vitals aren’t being taken care of."</em></a><br>
<br>
March 18, 2014: <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/so-who-gets-to-be-an-operator/"><em>"See, I’m a cake-eating civilian most of my time too, and only serve as a part-timer: U.S. Army Reservist. I’ve been in 12 years, through 3 different units, and no deployments. Yup, you read that right. No deployments. I am also a paper pusher by MOS — Chief Warrant Officer Paper Pusher, to be exact. So I won’t waste anybody’s time trying to put my hand into the “Operator” cookie jar, grabbing at crumbs. I am a civilian at heart, and I know it, and I am glad for it."</em></a></blockquote>

He will, apparently, be deployed (for the first time) while Sasquan is happening, so he won't be there.<br>
<br>
This is not at all to denigrate or mock his service.<br>
<br>
But you seem to be putting forward the idea that he is the way he is because he was isolated from American society while serving in a combat zone. He has never seen service in a combat zone, he has been a part-time soldier in the Reserve for his entire military career, I don't think that any of his work for the Army has taken him outside the U.S. or away from his family for more than 2 weeks at a time.<br>
<br>
He is not alienated because of his wartime service.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/145062" target="_self">soundguy99</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009347" target="_self">6:42 PM</a>  on April 14, 2015

You go to such angular and absurd efforts to portray me in an unfavorable light: why not portray me as I am?"</em>   I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what Wright is getting at here. OK, this is kind of inside baseball, but Wright is a lawyer and should be able to remember tort law from the first year of law school.  <br>
<br>
Here's the thing:  under common law, a libel is a written misrepresentation about someone whose reputation is harmed by that misrepresentation.  And truth is generally an absolute defense to charges of slander (verbal misrepresentation)  or libel (written misrepresentation).   In the US at least, if you call someone a lying murdering scumbag and s/he sues you for libel/slander, if you can prove to a court that such person is in fact a lying murdering scumbag, that person has no cause of action against you.  So Wright seems to be actually saying, "Even though I wrote and published these horrendous but clearly heartfelt things in a medium which theoretically allowed millions upon millions of people around the globe to read them, I'm going to take them down and act as though I never said them.  So, hah!  All you people misrepresenting my positions can't use my own words to prove the truth of what you're saying about me."<br>
<br>
There are so many things wrong with those two sentences of his that it's hard to know how to list them all.  Tactically: a mistake.  Technically: shows a complete lack of understanding how the internet works.  Legally: seems to show a profound misunderstanding of tort law.

True, and even if wrong, the defence can steal a page out of the Blumenthal v. Drudge playbook and threaten to summon everyone who might be a witness (assuming deep enough pockets.) <br>

But it wouldn't even go that far since "lying anti-gay scumbag" is likely to be considered an opinion and therefore, not defamation. "Lying murdering scumbag" is a mixed statement of fact since a jury can determine wrongful death as a question of fact.

Although that is a scary decision, I note that 1) the ultimate case result was that the plaintiff lost his claim of libel, and 2) at least in a very sketchy first read-through of articles surrounding the appellate court decision, that court seemed to rely on a circa 1902 Massachusetts statute which said truth was a defense unless "actual malice is proved."  So one wonders whether other jurisdictions would be willing to rely on a decision based on a 1902 statutory exception which would seem to be limited to Massachusetts.<br>

For what it's worth.

Excerpt: <blockquote>For the past several months, I have been toiling over an outline for the Hugo Award Ceremony. I had some really nice stuff written. I had planned a statistical analysis of the nominations -- can't do that now. I had planned to tease Connie Willis and Mike Resnick about all their awards and ask them to leave something on the table for someone else. That joke won't work anymore. I had written some witty banter about how Tananarive and I, as co-hosts, represent diversity in the field. A young black woman and an old gay man, we touch all the bases. Even that joke seems pointless now.<br>
<br>
I had asked Connie Willis to present the Campbell award -- she declined. Because she cannot pretend that this year's awards are business as usual.<br>
<br>
In fact, none of us can. And as the host of the award ceremony, I can't either.<br>
<br>
So, Brad, Larry, Vox -- congratulations. You've spoiled the party. Not just mine, but everyone's.<br>
<br>
I waited nearly a half century to get here, and when I do get here, there's ashes. </blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009671" target="_self">1:46 AM</a>  on April 15, 2015

By accounts an unbearable, impossible to work with person who acts badly and yet, because he has more talent in a single toenail clipping (and not from one of the bigger toes) than all the Puppies put together have in their entire bodies he has been more-or-less embraced by the field and received all the awards you could name.<br>
<br>
(Yes I realize he is complicated and am not simply writing him off as "unbearable".  He contains multitudes.)<br>
<br>
These guys don't win awards not because fandom doesn't like them but because they mostly write crap.  When they don't write crap they get nominated for awards.  Or, like Orson Scott Card, become one of only 3 authors in history to have two novels win both the Hugo and Nebula awards, and he did it back to back.  <br>

Similarly, for whatever you think of Ellison he's a proud outspoken leftist, and so the fact that he angers tons of people even on the left and alienated folks with his Connie Willis stunt wouldn't matter much to them either.  I imagine they see that sort of thing as the usual sort of People's Front of Judea leftist circular firing squad -- an "internal" squabble that doesn't affect their main point.<br>

<br>
Dear god reading their shit is so tiring.<br>
<br>
There's just no acknowledgement, ever, of the problems with what they did.<br>
<br>
"Sad Puppies 3 ... made the audacious claim that the totem for all, should be decided by all. Anyone willing to pay the poll tax (Worldcon membership) should have a say. We invited everyone to the democratic process."<br>
<br>
No you didn't.  WORLDCON made it so that anyone willing to pay $40 would have a say.  YOU exploited a quirk of the nomination rules so that a RELATIVELY SMALL MINORITY of the voters nonetheless dominated the selection process.<br>
<br>
There's no acknowledgement that maybe if they got on the ballot both before and after the whole Puppy thing existed, but didn't win, maybe that was because a majority of the people voting didn't think Warbound was the best novel of the year.  No, it must be a Conspiracy!<br>
<br>
There's this weird, well, sense of entitlement they seem to have.  Correia literally complained that, sure, Baen novels have been up for the award seven times before his, but they were all, like, by Baen's most popular author of all time (which isn't even true, incidentally, Bujold isn't the only other Baen writer to get a novel nomination.)  Poor unloved Baen, with only two best Novel Hugos!<br>
<br>
(Ace has three Hugo novel wins.  Ballantine has two.  Del Rey has one, that they finally nabbed in 2010 after first getting a book on the ballot in 1979.  DAW has one, no winners for them since 1982.  I could go on.  For a long time.  Even if I only restrict it to publishing houses that have ever won anything at all.)<br>
<br>
I haven't even scratched the surface ... Torgersen's definition of racism that excludes any acknowledgement of power differentials or history ... His increasingly weird failure to engage with the fact that the slate that got on is really Vox Day's, and that associating yourself with someone who literally advocates throwing acid at people may cause a reaction based on more than "tribalism" ... Torgersen and Correia's general, utter refusal to acknowledge that their own work has political elements, leading them to reflexively react to any criticism of sexism, racism, or homophobia by shouting back that the only possible motivation for such a criticism is misandry, racism, or heterophobia on the part of the critic ...<br>

This is a problem with the Right (and especially the religious Right) these days. They cannot abide being challenged in any way and claim disagreement as persecution. Any disagreement or even contrary evidence is seen as a direct affront, to be shouted down if possible and ignored if not. It's funny how the Puppies present themselves as not being heard when their real goal is to have only one voice heard -- their own. They seem incapable of accepting that their voice has been heard over and over -- and largely rejected (at least in the prose they want to wrap it in).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/85423" target="_self">GenjiandProust</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009837" target="_self">9:45 AM</a>  on April 15, 2015

		<a name="6009878"></a><div class="comments"><i>This hole in the Hugo process has been known for years.</i><br>
<br>
Yes. It was deemed safer to close by social means. One complaint the WSFS-BM has gotten from some is that the Hugo and Site Selection votes are too complex. They are more complex than First-Past-The-Post voting, but we deliberately chose STV because of real issues with FTP. However, that did bias us into not wanting to make nominations any more complicated, and because of the response to the Scientologists trying to pack the Hugos back in 1986-1987, the social contract of "don't slate vote" worked very well until outsiders came in and ignored it. <br>
<br>
Obviously, that's now changing, and talk is flying about in various places (I'm sure SMOFS-L is melting down right now) about what to do. Thankfully, there's a few months before the business meeting, so the worst ideas shouldn't even get close. And lordy, there are some *bad* ideas out there. <br>
<br>
<i> During that time it was notoriously the case that Worldcon business meetings were dominated by obsessive geeks that treat rules of order as if they were a cross between a game of Flux and Diplomacy.</i><br>
<br>
There was a time in the 1970s where this was very much true, but it hasn't been that way for a long time. There are  a number of folks who are experts in our parliamentary system (Robert's Rules Of Order, Newley Revised (RONR)) but in general, they all believe the same thing, the system is there to be fair, not to be gamed, and motions designed to game the system are rapidly slapped down by the chair as dilatory and the chair is supported by the meeting.<br>
<br>
However, there is the impression that we're hostile to new business, and that's a fair impression, because we backed ourselves into a corner. One motion in the system is "Postpone Indefinitely", which for a short term meeting such as this one, becomes a kill motion -- if you postpone something without scheduling, there's never enough time to bring it back. We didn't like that, so we barred it by standing rule. Tabling a motion (in the US sense) has the same problem so we limit that as well, but we didn't bar it because we do use it for committee-of-the-whole work.<sup>*</sup><br>
<br>
Then someone dug out OTC. Objection to Consideration. It's an incidental motion, but it's a very highly privileged one. In most parliamentary bodies, it's very rarely seen, because it's purpose is to stop things that you simply do not want to discuss. "Moved, that the member from Hillbourough is a bucket of" "Object to Consideration!" <br>
<br>
OTC has to be called before *any* debate, but if it is, it trumps. There's no debate, you vote immediately, and if 2/3rds of the body agrees, the motion is dead and unrevivable. BANG. <br>
<br>
But, remember how we'd killed Postpone Indefinitely? So, for motions that simply weren't going anywhere, this was the only tool we had to stop them early, and for people new to the process, they'd bring the motion, it would get OTC, and that was it. They never even got to debate it.<br>
<br>
I do not blame them for feeling that this was hostile. It was hostile -- but for things that were not going to pass, it was the only tool the meeting had to get them out of the way to get to business that might pass. It did not help that it would always be the most annoying voices in the room yelling "Object to consideration."<br>
<br>
So, *FINALLY* they fixed it (after I stopped going to Worldcons, of course.) During the preliminary business meeting only, the motion of Postpone Indefinitely is allowed, and unlike OTC, it is debatable, 2 minutes per side. So, you get a chance to say *why* we should discuss a motion. If you can get 1/3rd of the meeting to agree with you, then the motion will fail and it'll move to the main meeting. If you can't, it'll get PI'd  -- but even then, we could bring it back later if something changed by suspending the rules (against bringing amendments not approved by the preliminary meeting) and rescheduling the motion. But now you get a chance to speak, and it's a big difference in how welcoming the meeting appears. <br>
<br>
OTC is still there, but back to it's original purpose. It now requires a 75% supermajority for the insta-perma-kill, and if you want to move that So-and-so is a dirty so-and-so, it'll get OTC'd or ruled out of order as a personal attack. <br>
<br>
Fundamentally, the point of these rules is to be fair -- to the minority, to the majority, and to the members not present. Kevin Standlee put it best -- the goal is to be fair. Being fair does not me you always win. But it is a process.<br>
<br>
Mark Olson described it as a true participatory democracy. If you are a member of WSFS, you have the vote -- but you *have* to participate in the process to use that vote.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Committee-of-the-whole is the way you say "Can we kind of skip process for a moment while we figure out what we need to do?" Since a committee is, by itself, its own parliamentary body, it can choose its own rules of procedure, or carefully not really chose any. So, you can "pause" the formal procedure, hack through a complicated amendment without dealing with a long stack of motions, and once you've got it, the CotW rises with one motion to amend-by-subtitition. <br>
<br>
Remember this trick if you're ever in a parliamentary situation that's getting complex. "Madame Chairman, I move we refer this motion to a committee of the whole with the direction to return a perfected motion." Once that committee seats, then you can just gather around a table and figure it out, then rise and (as directed) present the motion. Since everyone was there to perfect it, it'll usually pass quickly at that point.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009878" target="_self">10:22 AM</a>  on April 15, 2015

		<a name="6009907"></a><div class="comments">I recently saw a talk about how unspoken values in an organisation can make it harder to meet goals while staying user-friendly. It was about design decisions for websites, but I thought it was more  generally applicable. It seems to me that the Worldcon committee has been relying on some unspoken values in their rules, like 'be fair' and 'don't abuse the loopholes we all know are there'. But that's probably not a good long-term solution now that time and the internet are increasing the fan base beyond the group who knew and understood those values. <br>

The solution in the talk was to bring those values to the surface and make them explicit. For Worldcon, I wouldnt necessarily make them rules, but part of a values or principles statement thingy that summarises the point of the rules. That way they can be used to guide rule-making but also so newcomers can be informed before they start rocking the boat.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/76925" target="_self">harriet vane</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009907" target="_self">10:56 AM</a>  on April 15, 2015

		<a name="6009970"></a><div class="comments"><i>For WorldCon it stopped working in 2014 and they should have fixed it then.</i><br>
<br>
By the rules, they can't fix it in one year -- a change to the constitution has to pass the business meeting and then be ratified by the next business meeting, it then takes effect for the next convention<sup>*</sup>. Indeed, there's a change waiting to be ratified to then require the membership-as-a-whole to vote yes-no on that change the year after, which would make it even longer. <br>
<br>
In fact, they didn't take any measures, and the way that 2+1 was written states that it itself needs to be approved, so even if it is approved this year, it would go to the members next year. Yeah, that's complicated. <br>
<br>
So, amendments passed this year could be ratified by next year's meeting (2016) and they would take effect at the end of the convention and be in effect at the 2017 Worldcon. Amendments passed next year (2016) would need to be ratified by the meeting in 2017, and if 2+1 fully ratifies, they would then need an up-and-down vote of the membership in 2018 to become part of the constitution, if successful they would then take effect at the 2019 Worldcon. If 2+1 fails to ratify (and I suspect it will be at least punted for a bit) then the final ratification vote won't be needed, and amendments proposed in 2016 would need to be ratified in 2017, and would take effect for the 2018 Worldcon. <br>
<br>
The system is deliberately designed to be slow to change. Normally, this is a feature, but this year, it might be a bug, but given some of the issues we had in the 1970s, the idea of quickly changing the constitution became anathema to WSFS. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Or, more precisely: Once ratified, it *immediately* becomes part of the WSFS Constitution, so you could make a motion to amend it. This being a constitutional amendment, it would need to be ratified by the next year's business meeting.  However, the actual Worldcon you're at when you ratified the amendment follows the Constitution as it was at the start of the convention, so if you've just added a new Hugo, they don't have to rush out and award it in a day. They operate under the old rules, and the next convention would be required to enact the amendment you just ratified, so in this example, they would award the new Hugo. <br>
<br>
Why? Simple practicality -- the next Worldcon needs to know what it needs to do. There's no way it can know what amendments are actually going to ratify, or in what form. So, we don't make it guess. They know, basically a year out, what the state of the WSFS Constitution they have to follow is, and when the business meeting adjourns <i>sine die</i>, that sets the state of the WSFS Constitution for the next Worldcon.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6009970" target="_self">11:40 AM</a>  on April 15, 2015

Actually I found his post about tribalism fucking spot on up to the point when he's talking about the Hugo. <blockquote> The Hugos (and the Worldcon tribe alike) brand the Hugo as the award for the entirety of SF/F: books, stories, movies, television, music, art, you name it.

<a href="http://sasquan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WSFS-Business-Passed-on-to-Sasquan-1.pdf">Business passed on</a> (pdf, picky levels of detail) :<br>
<br>
1) Popular Ratification ("2+1") -- requires amendments to the Constitution to be ratified by the next meeting and then a popular vote of the next Worldcon's membership.<br>
<br>
2) A Story By Any Other Name -- Amends Article 3 (the Hugos) to clarify that category eligibility should be based on content, not on format or delivery. Call this the MKR Amendment -- indeed, I think she either made the original motion or seconded it.<br>
<br>
3) Hugo Finalists -- Changes the name of the five who make the final ballot from "nominees" to "finalists" in Article 3, clearing up confusion about what a "nominee" is. <br>
<br>
4) WSFS Membership Types and Rates -- Bars conventions from selling a membership with voting rights for less than the cost of a supporting membership. <br>
<br>
And that's it. So, no, nothing about changing Hugo Nominations from 2014, other than the five making the ballot will potentially be called "finalists" rather than "nominees."<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010125" target="_self">1:06 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

<br>
I once participated in a minor way in some rules-fixing to avoid disaster in a vaguely similar situation (people with values orthogonal to the larger organization exploited some known loopholes). Do the Worldcon rules of order allow for clarifying previously unused terms in to-be-ratified amendments? In this case, defining "finalist" in such a way that doesn't allow for slate voting. I realize that's pretty heavy lawyering, but if it could serve as a stop-gap until an actual amendment could be fully ratified. Nobody in the case I mentioned was happy with that solution, but it was the only way to avert a complete disaster, comparable to the Hugo Awards nominations being hijacked by slate-voting.</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010232" target="_self">2:13 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

<br>
Be nominated in the written story categories, that is. The ruling before was an audiobook only release wasn't written fiction, thus couldn't be nominated for Best Novel/Novella/Novelette/Short Story. In this ruling, it could have been nominated as BDP-S, it was transferred to that category, but didn't make the ballot there. The work was "The Lady Astronaut of Mars" by Mary Robinette Kowal. <br>
<br>
The next year, the written version of that work made the ballot and won Best Novelette. It was explicitly allowed because it was declared a transformed work. Normally, that happens going from written to BDP, and this one went the other way, but the precedent was clear there. <br>
<br>
The general meta-rule is <i>Vox Populi</i>, if enough people nominate something as X, it's X. However, there are some bright lines. The Hugo administrator that year decided that one of the bright lines was that Best Novel/Novella/Novelette/Short Story are for written fiction (3.2.5 in the Constitution calls them the "written fiction categories",)  therefore an audio work couldn't be nominated, even though it was just a reading of a written fiction work. <br>
<br>
This motion grants the administrator the flexibility to take an audiobook only story and file it as a story rather than as a dramatic presentation if they feel (and the nominators feel) that it is more of a story via audio than a dramatic presentation -- so, it generally extends the flexibility we already grant the administrator in cases where the nominating public says "this is really an X."<br>
<br>
Note that the motion has passed at Loncon 3, but not ratified yet. <br>
<br>
Yes, there are concerns that we could have a work be eligible for two Hugos at once, which is *not* explicitly prohibited between things like BDP and the written categories. So, you could see an administrator deciding not to decide on a spilt and finding that an audio works makes the ballot in both Best Novelette and BDP-S. Historically, the sense of WSFS is that this shouldn't happen, but it has not been explicitly ruled out, and perhaps that needs to be done. <br>
<br>
This would *force* the Hugo admin to either transfer nominations or void-as-invalid the ones in the wrong category, which is problematic as well.<br>
<br>
In short, it's never as easy as it seems.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010247" target="_self">2:20 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

Torgersen is saying that the Hugos/Worldcon present <em>themselves</em> "as the award for the entirety", not necessarily that everyone else agrees.

<br>
WSFS won't touch that with a 10' pole, and I'm with them completely on that. <br>
<br>
How do you enforce that? Declare "identical" ballots to be a slate? What if they just email each other the slate rather than put on the website? There's so many ways that this could go wrong that, to me, it's a non-starter. <br>
<br>
I don't see a practical way to ban slate voting. If there's a fix, it's going to come in minimizing the harm of slate voting, either by minimizing the effectiveness, or by detecting it and expanding the ballot to make sure the works that would have been knocked off will still be on the ballot.<br>
<br>
Frankly, the 2016 Hugos are going to be less than fun as well, and it'll take a lot more than 3000 nominators to block a 200 person slate ballot. Go do the math, it's a very effective tactic. However, there may well be a lot more than 3000 nominators next year.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010256" target="_self">2:25 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

<br>
Would you want to attend this one? Not I!<br>
<br>
I have in fact been to one -- I was an acceptor for one of the fan writers. He didn't win, so basically, I got to put on a suit, never read a speech, and then get some fancy nosh in the party. <br>
<br>
<i>Torgersen is saying that the Hugos/Worldcon present themselves "as the award for the entirety", not necessarily that everyone else agrees.</i><br>
<br>
WSFS certainly doesn't. Witness Section 1.2 of the WSFS Constitution.<br>
 <blockquote>Section 1.2: Objectives. WSFS is an unincorporated literary society whose functions are:<blockquote>

(1) To choose the recipients of the annual Hugo Awards (Science Fiction Achievement Awards).<br>
<br>
(2) To choose the locations and Committees for the annual World Science Fiction Conventions (hereinafter referred to as Worldcons).<br>
<br>
(3) To attend those Worldcons.<br>
<br>
(4) To choose the locations and Committees for the occasional North American Science Fiction Conventions (hereinafter referred to as NASFiCs).<br>
<br>
(5) To perform such other activities as may be necessary or incidental to the above purposes.</blockquote></blockquote>

So, yeah. That's what they do. They don't assert anything other than they are "Science Fiction Achievement Awards." The fact that they've been around for as long as they have and, until this year, have been run fairly is why they've become a major award, but that's it. The only thing that WSFS asserts is the Hugo is an award of achievement in Science Fiction that they give out. (And let's just pretend the word Fantasy is in there, because that's eligible too -- it's called out explicitly in 3.2.1)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010275" target="_self">2:35 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

<br>
It's not the SMOFs. They've been trying to figure out how to cope with this, because this has real world implications. They have to deal with the actual ceremony, which is not likely to be Happy Fun Time given all the talk between the RPs and fandom, including the terms "war" and "destroying the Hugos" and other such fun things and dealing with what appears is going to be one of the largest Hugo votes ever. <br>
<br>
It started as Worldcon fandom-as-a-whole, and it's extended beyond that. Fandom is more and more upset, and as the RPs ratchet up the rhetoric, they're getting more upset and taking more action. <br>
<br>
But the people actually running Sasquan and dealing with the Business Meeting and Hugo Awards in particular are dealing with the actual practical problems of this, and the folks at Midwestcon 2, the 2016 Worldcon in Kansas City, are dealing with both getting their convention off the ground *and* having to run the Hugo Losers party. <br>
<br>
They're kind of on the sharp end of the stick right now. They really don't have time to be upset on the Internet.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010362" target="_self">3:34 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

<br>
Yes. Without guessing to either writer's motives, it's clear social pressure is working on at least some of the people nominated by either group of Puppies and Bellet and Kloos are either smart enough to jump from a sinking ship or decent enough not to want to be on the Hugo ballot this way. Either way, they should be appreciated for their stance. <br>
<br>
Hopefully this will open the doors for some of the other people nominated who've come out as being nominated by the Puppies slate without their knowledge or permission to withdraw themselves from consideration. <br>

<br>
We know a couple of cases where they failed to do so, but Larry Correia did at least try to clear most of the people on the slate, so I'm willing to attribute that mistake rather than malice. <br>
<br>
And, you know what, what's done is done, and they've withdrawn. The more that do so, the less effective the slate becomes. Just because it took them a while to do the correct thing doesn't mean they didn't do the correct thing. <br>

This new development of nominated writers withdrawing feels very powerful to me.  It feels like it puts the Puppies and their defenders in a very difficult position.  What can they say about this?  Are they going to attack the people they've previously been championing?<br>

I'm really uncomfortable qualifying Bellet's response as either 'smart' or 'decent', given that she's pretty obviously just upset and tired of being in between two groups of people in a war, neither of which are showing much compassion for her actual situation and both of whom are quite okay with accepting collateral damage.<blockquote> I don’t want to stand in a battlefield anymore.

We don't know that yet, because we don't know what #6 was on the slate. It could well be an SP/RP slate member who was pushed off by the two that weren't, so we'll just swap one for another.<br>

<br>
Yeah, I mean, I think probably a lot of the SP supporters will say that.  But the organizers?<br>
<br>
From what I've heard and seen, Torgersen and Correia have already burned a lot of goodwill and trust with all this.  For them, this is more than an Internet argument.  The writers who are withdrawing (and all the writers and editors and hard-core fans and the whole SFF world that is watching all this) are their peers and colleagues and potential collaborators and gateways to professional opportunities.<br>
<br>
So far, they seem to have shown more interest in playing to their redpill/Gamergate/culturewar supporters than to the SFF world.  You have to wonder how far they're going to take things, though.  These writers withdrawing ratchets up the pressure on them, I think.  <br>
<br>
I mean, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they kept sinking to further and further paranoia and epistemic closure.  But doing so seems likely to burn them pretty hard (at least in the non-insane world--they could probably still have careers as professional conservative assholes, and maybe that's what they want.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73881" target="_self">overglow</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010409" target="_self">4:01 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

I mean, mock quotes aside, here's the thing. Reactions from the left are part of the reasons that Bellet at least withdrew - and people in this very thread expressed that they hoped that the people on the slate did feel pressured. So while no, I'm sure that they're not being danced like puppets on strings, to say that your particular wing of fandom holds no blame whatsoever for these choices is disingenuous at best.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010418" target="_self">4:05 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

No, actually.<br>

It's reactions from fandom. I know *plenty* of very conservative fans who have the exact same disdain for what the SP/RP slate has done that very liberal fans have.

SP defenders keep saying that the people who are upset with them are evil SJWs who hate people because they have the wrong politics and keep ignoring the real and large contingent of people who are upset with them for their behavior, for the choices they've made, for the way they've broken the social contract around not slate-voting for the Hugos.  Sure, for some people the association with Vox Day and the obnoxious anti affirmative action rhetoric also is a source of anger.  But the Puppies emphasize the politics because they have no good answer to the fact that they're violated the spirit of the process.  <br>
<br>
There's a Heinlein quote that's been going around that I think is appropriate:
<blockquote>The rules permitted a contestant to submit any number of entries as long as each was written on a Skyway Soap wrapper or reasonable facsimile.<br>
<br>
I considered photographing one and turning out facsimiles by the gross, but Dad advised me not to. "It is within the rules, Kip, but I've never yet known a skunk to be welcome at a picnic."</blockquote>

If this was simply a left/right fight, well, I doubt the nominees would have withdrawn.

Convention-going fandom is vocal but not all that big compared to the book-buying world at large. Correia's a <i>New York Times bestseller.</i> Baen's not going to dump someone moving that many books, and readers aren't going to dump Baen for publishing him any more than they've dumped Tor for publishing Card. They're still going to have fiction careers and might well see a net gain in fans as they lose convention-going fandom and gain gamergaters.<br>
<br>
I believe you're absolutely right, of course, that a whole bunch of anthology invites and convention guest invites and other professional opportunities that could have come their way won't be there because of all the good reason they've given people to think they'd be unpleasant to work with. The things that are the sort of dues-paying Martin and Gerrold have mentioned that could have contributed to them getting the award down the road.<br>

<br>
I've actually been sort of wondering about the role Baen has played in this whole kerfuffle. Not that I think they're behind the Puppies, but rather that they've helped create the climate in which Torgensen and Correira could feel justified to grief the Hugos. <br>
<br>
Because so much of their justification about why they deserve awards if not for those evil liberals sound so much like people like Eric Flint where bleating about in rec.arts.sf.written a decade and a half ago: that sales are the only measure of quality, that conservative sf is overlooked or disdained by the SF elite, that all that matters is writing good apolitical adventure stories should be the pinnacle of any writer's ambitions, undsoweiter. <br>
<br>
Baen is also the publisher which was proud to be compared to Del Monte tinned fruit, liking that their writers were mostly interchangeable and it has deliberately cultivated an Us against the rest of the world among its fan base. All of which was sort of kept on a low boil when Jim Baen was still alive, who was always much more eclectic in his tastes than his readers were, but under the new management they seem to have followed the Teabaggers culture wars handbook.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010488" target="_self">4:40 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

Baen's not going to dump someone moving that many books, and readers aren't going to dump Baen for publishing him any more than they've dumped Tor for publishing Card. They're still going to have fiction careers and might well see a net gain in fans as they lose convention-going fandom and gain gamergaters.</i><br>
<br>
I see it as mostly a tempest in a teapot consisting of big-name fans and authors. Granted, it has the potential to become a very ugly tempest if it escalates to doxing, terrorist threats, and swatting as we saw with gamergate. But most of the people who buy books are just going to go to Amazon or B&amp;N and pick up whatever is marketed based on the blurb and the author's name.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010545" target="_self">5:14 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

		<a name="6010639"></a><div class="comments">So, because I am, apparently, a crazy person, I decided to see for myself just how badly poor old Baen Books had been treated by the Hugo Awards.  So I made a little chart of all the Publishers who had ever won a Hugo for best novel (trying as best I could to group imprints of the same company together), and looked at three aspects:<br>
<br>
Number of Nominations (is the Conspiracy keeping Baen off the Ballot?)<br>
Number of Wins (is the Conspiracy denying Baen victory?)<br>
Ratio of Wins to Nominations (is the Conspiracy keeping Baen from its rightful share?)<br>
<br>
So first, the numbers:<br>
<br>
Tor Books – 38 Nominations, 8 Wins, 0.21 Win Ratio<br>
Bantam Books or Bantam Spectra or Spectra Books – 24 Nominations, 6 Wins, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
Ace Books – 22 Nominations, 3 Wins, 0.14 Win Ratio<br>
Harper &amp; Row or HarperCollins or HarperPrism or William Morrow or Morrow or Eos – 18 Nominations, 8 Wins, 0.44 Win Ratio<br>
Galaxy Science Fiction – 13 Nominations, 6 Wins, 0.46 Win Ratio<br>
Doubleday – 12 Nominations, 4 Wins, 0.33 Win Ratio<br>
Ballantine Books – 12 Nominations, 3 Wins, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction – 12 Nominations, 2 Wins, 0.17 Win Ratio<br>
Del Rey Books – 12 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.08 Win Ratio<br>
Putnam Publishing Group or Berkeley Putnam – 11 Nominations, 3 Wins, 0.27 Win Ratio<br>
Orbit Books – 11 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.09 Win Ratio<br>
The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction – 9 Nominations, 2 Wins, 0.22 Win Ratio<br>
Baen Books – 8 Nominations, 2 Wins, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
Astounding Science Fiction – 8 Nominations, 2 Wins, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
St. Martin’s Press – 4 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
Victor Gollancz or Gollancz – 4 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
DAW – 4 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
Warner Books or Warner Questar or Warner Aspect – 4 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.25 Win Ratio<br>
Bloomsbury Publishing – 3 Nominations, 2 Wins, 0.67 Win Ratio<br>
If – 3 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.33 Win Ratio<br>
Chilton Company – 2 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.50 Win Ratio<br>
Houghton Mifflin – 2 Nominations, 1 Win, 0.50 Win Ratio<br>
J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. – 1 Nomination, 1 Win, 1.00 Win Ratio<br>
Dial Press – 1 Nomination, 1 Win, 1.00 Win Ratio<br>
Night Shade Books – 1 Nomination, 1 Win, 1.00 Win Ratio<br>
<br>
Now, a little analysis:<br>
<br>
Median Number of Nominations: 8<br>
Number of Nominations for Baen: 8<br>
<br>
Median Number of Wins: 2<br>
Number of Wins for Baen: 2<br>
<br>
Median Win Ratio: 0.25<br>
Win Ratio for Baen: 0.25<br>
<br>
Oh my god.  The numbers do not lie.<br>

Oh, yeah.  If you want to include Publishers who were nominated but never won, Pyramid Books were 0 for 4, Avon Publications were 0 for 5, Timescape Books were 0 for 3, Arbor House was 0 for 3, Harcourt was 0 for 3, and there were a whole bunch that were 0 for 1.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to include Sci-Fi and Fantasy Publishers who were never even nominated, I'm not sure how you'd even do that but there's loads, especially when you consider Small Press etc.<br>

&gt; "The Baenzillas probably don't count Bujold (who alone accounts for 6 of their 7 pre-puppy nominations) for... reasons... and stuff..."<br>
<br>
While I didn't analyze it, incidentally, it didn't look that unusual for a big chunk of nominations to come from a single author, or a couple of authors, for the mid-chart Publishers.  I mean, it was by no means all of them, some were and some weren't, but most of DAW's nominations are Cherryh, for example.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010667" target="_self">6:40 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

		<a name="6010690"></a><div class="comments">Yeah, the obsession with Scalzi as the Enemy of All That is Right(-Wing) can't be justified based on his professional writing.  His major series has been Heinlein pastiche - the first of which was explicitly Starship Troopers inspired -  and his other stuff doesn't really  work any "SJW" tropes, that I'm aware of.  He's not Octavia Butler or anything.<br>
<br>
Now, there's a *kernel* of truth in their obsession with him as the center of a cabal.  Scalzi is a self-promoter and schmoozer par excellence, and that's undoubtedly done him a lot of good in terms of editor/author/SMOF goodwill and such.  He's absolutely part of an insider group with the NHs, Doctorow, etc.  BUT a) mentioning your book is Hugo-eligible is nowhere near this slate horseshit, b) people have been buddy buddy in SF since the dawn of the genre - it's a small industry, and people know each other, c) Hugo voting has always been *less* personality driven than say, the Nebula, which was infamous for logrolling, and d) being a nice person is an option open to everyone, not just Scalzi.  90% of success is showing up, and not being a dick.  The SP/RP group decided that frothing at the mouth was the better path, though.<br>
<br>
<small>My personal criticism of Scalzi is that I don't think he is working up to his potential.  It's fine to say, "I write what I do because that's where the money is," but at least sometimes try something more challenging?  Cripes, even a hack like Piers Anthony gave a shot at the Great American SF Novel in Macroscope.  Admittedly, he failed, and it's as problematic as most of his work, but he did *try*.<small></small></small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/10825" target="_self">Chrysostom</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010690" target="_self">7:00 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

I think they must view him the equivalent of a "race traitor" to a group of white supremacists.  He's a guy with every single one of the hallmarks of someone who should be on their side (even to writing Heinlein pastiches) and yet he publicly recognizes them as ethically, socially, and mentally deficient.  Nothing could be more enraging.<br>
<br>
<i>My personal criticism of Scalzi is that I don't think he is working up to his potential.</i><br>
<br>
I agree.  <i>Redshirts</i> was the most slight and inconsequential novel to win the Hugo in decades, even more than the Sawyer a while back and I froth at the mouth just thinking about the Sawyer win. <br>
<br>

Actually, I'd bet you any amount of money that the SPs and RPs will take the "more in sorrow than anger" approach, and regret that these poor souls were forced to cave in under pressure by the heinous SJWs all around.  And for what it's worth, I'm sorry for them too.  They got stuck in the middle of something they clearly didn't see was coming.  But they won't take heat from the Day/Correia/Wright crowd, because that would undermine the SP/RP original position that this was all about QUALITY, people. Period.<br>
<br>
You should also check out Dave Freer's latest posts on the Mad Genius blog (I'm not going to bother linking to them, you can google them if you're interested and I'm lazy), where he spends several thousand words demonstrating to his satisfaction that Teresa D.H. is an evil leaker and otherwise a horrible soul, who conspired with others in a smokey back room somewhere to limit the nominations (and therefore the potential wins) of politically incorrect writers.  I couldn't make my way all through his post without starting to bleed through my eyeballs, but I didn't see any argument about why a slate was a good idea, except for the "they did it first (albeit in a sneaky and smoke-filled back room kind of way)" defense.  <br>

The weird thing is that I LIKE Freer's fiction.  And I'm going to keep reading it and buying it.  But,  jeez.

1) N. H, but really, universally, just note her as TNH. Everyone else does. <br>
<br>
2) The first leaker was one Micheal Z. Williamson, who announced a couple of weeks before the release that he'd been nominated. This, BTW, is *very* much against the social contract. <br>
<br>
3) Everyone in publishing rapidly gets a sense of who's nominated, because of the preponderance of shit-eating grins. The thing that stood out this year was the complete lack of shit-eating grins. That's what led to the rumors that something wasn't normal this year.<br>
<br>
4) If anybody thinks they can scare TNH? Well, think again. She's been through vastly more shit than you can possibly imagine. She deals with a crippling neurological disorder daily. She's lived in bad NYC neighboorhoods. Your words on the Internet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br>
<br>
She still is one of the most clever, erudite and funny people I've ever met, and I'm am utterly honored and chuffed to call her a friend. We only get to see each other once every half decade anymore, and we immediately fall back into the last conversation we were on, break open the nearest bottle of whatever good strong liquor is nearby, and the hours disappear again. I have literally dressed her wounds, and I'd do that again in a heartbeat. We've laughed together -- which is a problem when you have cataplexy and this leaves you lying on a street in San Jose -- we've cried together, we've mocked together, and when she's gone, I will be one broken person, but I'll get over it, because if I don't, she will crawl out of the grave and kick my ass. <br>
<br>
And if you don't know her? Well, I'm honestly sorry for you. Maybe you should get over whatever reason that is and talk to her. She loves talking to people -- and while she does not suffer fools gladly, the Metafilter Test pretty much ensures anybody on this thread will not fall into the fool category. She'd be happy to talk with you all. So, if you're at Sasquan, go talk to her. Tell her I said you should say hi.  (Erik V. Olson, in full.) If you want bring an offering, she love good tequila, her husband loves good rye.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6010861" target="_self">9:42 PM</a>  on April 15, 2015

I'd really love to know more about that.  I'm kind of assuming, based on previous track record, that Nemisin probably did something horrible like acknowledge white privilege and point out that we live in a racist society and there are systemic imbalances.  Because that's the kind of thing that made the unbalanced wingnut in my life flip out and start screaming that I was bullying him and being racist toward him, and that's the kind of overreaction that I'm learning to expect from Correia.

Yep.<br>
<br>
So, to attempt to put this into SJW terms, did a Person of Color (man, I hate that stupid term) aggress against another Person of Color who was also committing aggressions? I think so, but I got an accounting degree instead of gender studies, so I’m not sure.</em><br>
<br>
Here is the <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/06/continuum-goh-speech/">speech</a> that Jemisin gave at Continuum. It's quite moving, and funny in places, too; just an all-around good speech, regardless of if you agree with the point she's making (I do.)<br>

Well, no, because what you describe with handwavey vagueness as "somewhat mocking about people talking about their abuse triggers" could be literally anything.  I still have no idea what was allegedly said by her, but you want me to take you at your word that she's behaved "badly".  Given that you also categorize Vox Day's actions as "behaving badly", I really just can't get what you're about here.  Painting this in a "both sides are equally bad" way is really, really weird when one side is headed up by a legit white supremacist and people who are all too happy to be his stooges, and the other side is the people those guys regularly attack.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/61305" target="_self">palomar</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011011" target="_self">12:15 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

<br>
I'm starting to believe that people think that Torg/Correia/Vox (and sometimes me) are a holy <em>trinity</em> at this point, so to draw a roadmap:<br>
<br>
Vox Day: created Rabid Puppies, wants to burn the world and the Hugos down, a crazypants asshole. He is basically one step from jumping up and down and smearing feces on himself with a crazy grin. <br>
<br>
Correia: created Sad Puppies, former military contractor, no wartime experience<br>
<br>
Torgersen, not Correia, is the one with military experience, and you don't need to put quotes around 'wartime'. If someone has served their country in a time of war, they have wartime experience. Sure, Torgersen plays down his job as just a 'paper pusher', because that's what you<em> do</em>,  but those guys are crucial to the warfighting mission. If people's families aren't getting fed or housed or paid, you think the infantry can concentrate on their job of not getting killed? Hell to the no. Torg says he has no 'deployments', but mentions that he <em>does</em> have time overseas, which either means that he was posted overseas for a significant amount of time, or that he was sent for a short period of time - some call it <em>deployed</em> - to a place which is not America in order to further the wartime interests of the US military.<br>
<br>
And alienation takes place even for those people who do not directly serve in combat.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011015" target="_self">12:29 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

* Jemisin's advocacy comes from Critical Race Theory.<br>

* Therefore, Jemisin is a racist.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't buy it since Jemisin (and also Lord) take great pains to describe how systems of racial categorization are arbitrary and politically constructed. Jemisin gives us a whole mess of mixed-ethnicity characters who arbitrarily get or are denied power on that basis. Lord gives us (as part of her Afro-Caribbean creole model) a culture that discriminates based on visible phenotypes that are not genetically linked to the abilities claimed. Lord's setting also points out that people with brown skin are not ethnically or culturally homogenous.<br>

Race isn't an essential feature of human biology under this model, it's a political construct built on a history of slavery and immigration in North America.

<br>
Vets are funny critters who like to pick on each other a lot, but who generally close ranks when other people do. It's the old "Nobody gets to pick on my brother but me!" Like, I'm not going to lie and say I don't have a ton of jokes about admin, or officers, or Reservists, because I <em>totally do</em> - but it really rubs me the wrong way when civilians pick on any of the above. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I guess that I think it's nice to give people the benefit of the doubt and try to understand where they're coming from unless they've deliberately forfeited it. I don't really give Vox Day a lot of benefit of the doubt - I mean, I tend to think he's a troll because no human currently alive could really believe views as noxious as his seriously, but that may be my wishful thinking for humanity at work rather than trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>
But I do try to empathize with people who are not Vox Day. I mean, I even think I understand where a lot of people on sides I disagree on stand on this one, and I don't think it makes them bad people.

<br>
I understand where you're coming from, but this seems a bit off for three reasons:<br>
a) I think Sad Puppies 3 predates Rabid Puppies? Certainly the previous sad puppies campaigns do...<br>
b) As noted elsewhere, Correia and Vox are both in the "evil league of evil authors". Heck, Correia put Vox on his slate for Sad Puppies 2.<br>
c) In none of the recent posts have I ever seen Correia comment on Vox by just saying "Vox is a white supremacist. White supremacy is bad", or anything to that effect. It seems like a very small thing to say. I've seen variations on "I don't care about Vox's politics, I like the story", etc., but no "I don't like his politics." I think that the inability to say such a thing speaks to their personal closeness. As Torgersen noted in his own tribalism nonsense, it's hard to speak ill of someone in your tribe. And the evil league of evil authors sure  has a hard time speaking ill of one of its members.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011047" target="_self">1:06 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

I've never noticed you doing this with the people like (in this instance) Jemison. You'll bring up that maybe she behaved badly in web postings but you don't go another inch and say "Maybe she was cranky because [reasons I would make up for people like Torgersen/Wright/Correia];" I don't see you offering her a place at your table. So I'm going to disagree that you think it's nice to give benefit of the doubt to people, because you really only give it (publicly) to <em>some</em> people.  Please aim your empathy equally, because it really doesn't look like you do.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/43189" target="_self">rtha</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011049" target="_self">1:09 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

		<a name="6011057"></a><div class="comments">Torgersen's own <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/unpersoning/">rationale</a> for supporting Day is...really odd. He's clearly aware of Day's repellent words and actions, and while I don't totally agree with his dismissing Day as just a gadfly, I can see where he's coming from on it. The part that's <em>weird</em> is his characterization of people who are asking him to acknowledge and take a firm stance on Day's bigotry.<br>
<br>
It seems to me SFF fandom is and thinks of itself as a big tent, full of different priorities and opinions. Racefail, to take an example that's been touched on in this thread and in offsite discussion, had big names on both "sides" of the argument. Worldcon, if anything, is seen as the time when everyone comes together and has a drink and throws a party for the one thing we all love.<br>
<br>
But Torgersen, with his obsession with "tribal" divisions, concludes that <em>everyone</em>--his fans, people who may have supported or opposed or not have given a shit about Dead Puppies--are all shunning Vox Day because of...some sort of lockstep that has only just now manifested around Vox Day, and not because Day has said a lot of things that many people agree are awful in venues that many people agree were inappropriate, but because of some ingrained tribalism looking for a target. There's references to <em>gaslighting</em> in Torgersen's post (filtered through ST:TNG, but yet.)<br>
<br>
I worry this will come off disingenuous or concern-trolly, but I mean it when I say that it makes me wonder if there's something big and difficult in an unrelated sphere of his life that he's having trouble dealing with and that's spilling over, because it seems <em>really odd</em> for someone who otherwise comes off as a fairly level-headed guy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/117509" target="_self">kagredon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011057" target="_self">1:25 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

I agree, but in this matter you've shown empathy to one side only. You have not shown any empathy for the people hurt by the Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies, not those they've harassed verbally, nor those authors whose works were pushed off the Hugo ballot by slate voting. You could say that they've been shown plenty of empathy by other people in this thread, and that's true, but it's hard to understand your points about empathy and inclusiveness when it's all directed at SP/RP. I have empathy for everyone involved, but that doesn't mean I suspend judgment indefinitely.

<br>
I apologize if it's seemed that way! I haven't really been defending or pointing out that Jemisin also deserves the benefit of the doubt and needs empathy because it hasn't really seemed like anyone here has been questioning it. It's seemed like everyone at least on Metafilter <em>has</em> it. But I absolutely think that she was probably frustrated and exhausted from dealing with RaceFail, which I remember as being personally exhausting myself, and I was in no way someone on the front lines of that. I think that she was probably frustrated at feeling like her own concerns were being posed as lesser than other people's concerns, and as someone who feels often that their own concerns are ignored, that is a shitty starting place and tends to make you easier to rile. I mean, I myself have this problem! I struggle with it a lot. I think that she also probably was struggling with what it feels like when you're fighting about something important to you but you're also fighting with someone with their own issues that you feel like are important, and so maybe you say something shitty about their issues that any other day you might be cool about. <br>
<br>
I think that Jemisin should have done a lot of things differently, and I may not like her fiction writing, or the way that she thinks ostracization should work, but that doesn't mean I think she's a bad <em>person.</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011061" target="_self">1:32 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

In fact, what N. K. Jemisin, among others, did during RaceFail was behaving in that great Heinleinian tradition of not suffering fools gladly and telling people exactly where they get off.

Some mentions about how his Reserve work puts him at places like Fort Dix, NJ and Fort Jackson, SC, sometimes for longer than the standard two weeks. But not word one about being outside the U.S.<br>
<br>
<em>And alienation takes place even for those people who do not directly serve in combat.</em><br>
<br>
No doubt.  But the evidence so far is that he serves the standard one weekend a month plus two weeks plus some years an extra week or three. <br>
<br>
In the U.S. <br>
<br>
If he's alienated I doubt it's because of his service. <br>
<br>
And if he really is <em><strong>that</strong></em> alienated from modern American culture because of said moderate exposure to military life, then, frankly, he shouldn't be in the military.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/145062" target="_self">soundguy99</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011107" target="_self">2:26 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

The nominees get no satisfaction whether they win or lose. The organisers have to deal with an angry crowd for a pointless awards night. The attendees won't have any fun and no fan anywhere gets any good book recommendations.<br>

Following his "don't no award, don't change the rules" plan means that, at best, we end up with two slates next year, at worst, the RPs kill the Hugos. <br>
<br>
He may be willing to let them win. I am not. I have loaded Big Noa Ward, and it'll fire the moment the ballots open. Cry Havoc, and let slip the ballots of war!<br>
<br>
I despise people who call this the nuclear option. No Award is in the rules *for a reason*, and it's not there to never be used. The reason it hasn't been used since 1977 is that we haven't had a need. <br>
<br>
This, folks, is the nuclear option:
<blockquote>

Short Title: Kill Them All, Let Ghod Have the Hugos.<br>
<br>
Moved, that we amend the WSFS constitution as follows.<br>
<br>
1) Amend Section 1.2 as shown<blockquote>

Section 1.2: Objectives. WSFS is an unincorporated literary society whose functions are:<br>
<br>
<strike>(1) To choose the recipients of the annual Hugo Awards (Science Fiction Achievement Awards).</strike><br>
<br>
(2) To choose the locations and Committees for the annual World Science Fiction Conventions (hereinafter referred to as Worldcons).</blockquote>

2) Amend Section 2.1 as shown <blockquote>Section 2.1: Duties. Each Worldcon Committee shall, in accordance with this Constitution, provide for:<br>
<br>
<strike>(1) administering the Hugo Awards,</strike><br>
<br>
(2) administering any future Worldcon or NASFIC site selection required, and<br>
<br>
(3) holding a WSFS Business Meeting.</blockquote>

3) Amend Section 2.2 as shown.<blockquote>Section 2.2: Marks. Every Worldcon and NASFIC Committee shall include the following notice in each of its publications: “World Science Fiction Society”, “WSFS”, “World Science Fiction Convention”, “Worldcon”, “NASFiC”, <strike>“Hugo Award”, the Hugo Award Logo, and the distinctive design of the Hugo Award Trophy Rocket</strike> are service marks of the World Science Fiction Society, an unincorporated literary society.</blockquote>

4) Delete Article 3<br>
<br>
5) Amend Section 6.3 as shown <blockquote>Section 6.3: Electronic Voting. Nothing in this Constitution shall be interpreted to prohibit conducting <strike>Hugo Awards nominating and voting and </strike> Site Selection voting by electronic means, except that conducting Site Selection by electronic means shall require the unanimous agreement of the current Worldcon committee and all bidding committees who have filed before the ballot deadline. Valid paper ballots delivered by any means shall always be acceptable. This section shall not be interpreted to require that such elections be conducted electronically, nor shall it be interpreted to allow remote participation or proxy voting at the Business Meeting.</blockquote>

6) Direct the Nitpicking &amp; Flyspecking Committee to renumber sections and paragraphs as needed. </blockquote>

If you moved that at Sasquan, and it passes, you've launched the nuclear option. If it ratifies at Midamericon 2, the nuclear option detonates, and there are no 2017 or later Hugo Awards. Period. <br>
<br>
That's the nuclear options. *ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT* is not. So, don't let hyperbole sway you. No Awarding a few, many, or even all categories will not destroy the Hugos. Letting the Puppies control them will damage them beyond recognition, but will not destroy them. <br>
<br>
That motion above is what destroys the Hugos. Nothing short of it will.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011260" target="_self">9:03 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

<br>
And that's fucked up. You now have two competing Jurors. If we want the Hugos to have a Juried nomination process, there's a way to make that happen. You will primarily need to work with changing Section 3.7 through 3.9 of the WSFS constitution. Amend those as needed. <br>
<br>
But right now, the Hugos have a polled nomination process, and the sense-of-fandom is we'd like to keep that if possible, and selecting between two slates is barely keeping that, and if one of them is RP, really, that means one person has the power to nominate the Hugos and we've really screwed this up badly, haven't we?<br>
<br>
And if we have dozens of slates? If RP sticks to theirs and everyone votes their own, RP wins anyway. <br>
<br>
So, yeah. If we want a polled nomination process, we'll have to change how we do that.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011264" target="_self">9:12 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

<br>
Yeah, probably not (and this is why you can amend motions) but I deliberately constructed that motion as a "nuclear option", in that there would be absolutely nothing left of the Hugo Awards in the WSFS Constitution. It would be a complete abjuration of the idea. <br>
<br>
Currently, there's no way in hell it would pass, indeed, I doubt it would even be given the courtesy of a Postpone Indefinitely. I would expect a straight OTC, followed by a JPG of Zoidberg with the words "YOUR MOTION IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD."<br>
<br>
Although I would argue that, given the current state of the award and having no idea of what disasters await us next year, passing it this year just to have the option of detonating it next year is *not* an inconceivably bad idea -- and of course, passing it this year does not kill the Hugos, it would just give the Business Meeting at KC the option of doing so.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it's a *good* idea, mind you. I'm just saying that, unlike the last 25 years, it's not a inconceivably bad one. Maybe WSFS needs to go DEFCON 3. <br>
<br>
<i>I imagine there are other documents that would supersede the constitution in the case of IP, but why take the chance?</i><br>
<br>
Because of WSFS's oddball status, I don't think there is. There is a standing committee of WSFS, the Mark Protection Committee, that exists to protect the trademarks of the organization, but the marks they're empowered to protect are listed in Section 2.2. Delete the Hugos from there, and the authority of the MPC to protect them evaporates. While there may be filed trademarks, the MPC wouldn't have the authority to take action to defend them, and they'd soon fall for lack of defense.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011379" target="_self">10:38 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

Since Vox Day is Literally The Worst, and Torgerson, et al, are at least minimally responsive to peer pressure and market pressure, is there some way WorldCon can say "Vox Day as an author is no longer eligible for the Hugos; anything published by a publishing house owned by him in whole or in part is no longer eligible for the Hugos; he may no longer purchase WorldCon memberships to vote for the Hugos; and any ballots found to be influenced by his recommendations will be discarded, at the discretion of the Hugo administrator (who may decide if he's spitefully attempting to slate works he hates to get them removed).

<br>
GRRM, I think, is misreading this. <br>
<br>
He saw that 1300 supporting as the RPs coming to kill us all. Nope. I see those as the white blood cells coming to save the Hugos. Those supporting memberships showed up after the slate came out when fandom went THE FUCK and a bunch of people decided they needed to vote to make sure the RPs didn't get the award. <br>
<br>
<b>THIS IS A GOOD THING</b>. <br>
<br>
GRRM was angry that there there weren't enough nominators<sup>*</sup>. Guess what? There's 1300 more nominators now for 2016 and 2017. This is as it should be, right? <br>
<br>
Yes, it will involve a lot of No Awards this year. What I wish he'd understand is that this is *the correct answer* here. If the Best Novelette, in your opinion, is not on the slate, the correct answer is No Award. If you feel the category has been corrupted by improper nomination tactics, the correct answer is No Award. That's why we have very carefully maintained the No Award (and it's cousin None Of The Above in Site Selection.) There are no defaults -- just because you owned the ballot doesn't mean you win the Hugo. The voters are going to speak.<br>
<br>
Yes, the 2015 Hugos have taken a hit. Maybe they need to be sacrificed. I think we can redo them, but that's another argument for later. But Fandom as a whole is *well aware* now. We're going to, at the very least, be nominating and voting. That's what GRRM wants! We're also going to be looking at limiting slate effectiveness, and while he disagrees about that, I think that's the right answer. Our social rules limiting slates have failed. It's time for a process rule to do so. We just need to make sure we pick a good rule.<br>
<br>
Finally, he seems despondent that no matter what, VD will declare victory. SO FUCKING WHAT GEORGE? Why do you care what he thinks? It should be what *you* think that you care about, not what he thinks, and if you think that the Hugos have survived an attack, well, he can declare all the victories he wants. It does not matter. <br>
<br>
It's how *fandom* feels at the end of this. It's our award. If we save the Hugos, we win, and I don't care what VD say about winners and losers. We've lost the 2015 Hugos, we may well lose the 2016 Hugos, but if you want to give up on the award now? There's the motion, right up there, go make it! <br>
<br>
Then, get out the way. I'm not done with this damn award yet. <br>
<br>
<br>
* And lets talk about that. He's wrong about how a few more nominations would have stopped them. The problem is fannish nominators are picking five out of dozens, and slate voters are picking five out of five. It wouldn't take 200 fannish nominators to counteract 200 RPs nominators, it would take on the order of a magnitude more, and to be certain, close to two magnitudes more. <br>
<br>
That's why we need to limit the power of a single nominator to fill a ballot, because if they can multiply that power via a slate, then they can force others off. Even 3/6 dramatically limits the power to do so.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011453" target="_self">11:31 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

You could propose such at the business meeting, but again, the Exclusion Acts/Breendoggle, it would not go down well. Yes even for someone like him, Fandom would not put a blanket bar.<br>
<br>
As to banning for the conventions, matters for the conventions are left to the conventions, you'd need to first change that, then formalize a bar form the Worldcon, and that would be even less popular. <br>
<br>

To you? Sure. To racists, sexists, and bigots, it might have been raised immeasurably. There would still be a Hugo. Value changed is not value destroyed. Some value may have been destroyed, sure, but if other now value it, there's still value.  <br>

Which is one of the great weaknesses of fandom, of course, that inability/unwillingness to exclude even dangerous fuckwits from our community, that people got upset about excluding a known kiddie fiddler (even if not convicted at the time, his local fandom knew to keep their kids away from him, though they put most of the onus on the kids themselves to "barricade themselves in their rooms").<br>

That seems to be an article of faith amongst a particular type of (American) liberal, but I'm not sure that's actually true. We've seen that with the filibuster and the nuclear option there, where the Democrats were so afraid to limit the use of filibusters they did themselves more harm by allowing Republican intransigence to continue, than they avoided by keeping the filibuster alive for a mythical moment they could use it. <br>

<br>
Usual STV vote, of course it could win.<br>
<br>
<i>What would happen if it did?</i><blockquote>4.5.5: If “None of the Above” wins, or if two or more bids are tied for first place at the end of tallying, the duty of site selection shall devolve on the Business Meeting of the current Worldcon. If the Business Meeting is unable to decide by the end of the Worldcon, the Committee for the following Worldcon shall make the selection without undue delay.<br>
<br>
4.5.6: Where a site and Committee are chosen by a Business Meeting or Worldcon Committee following a win by “None of the Above,” they are not restricted by exclusion zone or other qualifications.<br>
<br>
4.5.7: Where a site and Committee are chosen by a Business Meeting or Worldcon Committee following a tie in tallying, they must select one of the tied bids.</blockquote>

It used to be explicitly written, and is now just implicit, that a NotA win disqualifies all the written bids, but the explicit bar was removed because the sense was they'd rather not have their hands tied and be force to vote for No Worldcon. The later change to allow the Business Meeting to pass the matter to the next Worldcon Committee makes this much less likely to happen, however. In fact, what would almost certainly happen should NotA win is the Site Selection meeting would very carefully drop the ball on this, and let the next concom deal with it, simply to give time for an emergency Worldcon bid to form or for the bid that failed to fix whatever annoyed everyone. (The most likely situation for NotA winning is there's only one bid on the ballot, and everyone hating it.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011483" target="_self">11:53 AM</a>  on April 16, 2015

<br>
No, to science fiction authors, readers, publishers and the news media who cover them. To the business world related to science fiction and those who create it. <br>
<br>
<em> Sure. To racists, sexists, and bigots, it might have been raised immeasurably. There would still be a Hugo. Value changed is not value destroyed. Some value may have been destroyed, sure, but if other now value it, there's still value.</em><br>
<br>
The awards have existed for more than 60 years. They quite literally are considered the highest possible honor the science fiction world can bestow on their members' achievements. That is their current value. It is a value that translates into actual opportunities for those nominated and awarded, in terms of not only recognition by publishers but contracts, advances and consideration of potential sales. Hugo awards and nominations help get authors and screenwriters hired for other projects, including screenplays for television and movies, inclusion of their other works in anthologies, various consulting opportunities, speaking gigs, etc. They typically also increase both the sales of the honored work and an author's other works.  <br>
<br>
That is the infrastructure the Hugos support. It is their brand, whose image propels sales and opportunities for content creators. Remove that infrastructure and the brand's <strong>practical worth</strong> collapses. Devaluing that brand isn't a zero sum game. You can slap a Lamborghini decal on an Edsel Corsair but that won't increase its practical value to a consumer. <br>
<br>
Sure, you can destroy a thing's value without making it completely useless to everybody. But from a practical perspective....<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18312" target="_self">zarq</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011494" target="_self">12:01 PM</a>  on April 16, 2015

You know, I find myself puzzled by this and by the "it doesn't matter if we award No Award, because there's nothing worth voting for" kind of ideas. If it doesn't matter what race Correia is, then why bother questioning his ethnicity? You can certainly call him an idiot without it. If the stories are universally going to be shit, then you don't have to talk loudly about how you're going to No-Award in protest - just read the damn stories, and rank them below No Award if you think they're shitty, which is what you're supposed to do every single year.

<br>
To really evaluate, you need to read more than just the finalists. The award is "Best X". You need to have a sense of the whole field, not just the five finalists.<br>
<br>
I've always argued that if you read *one* short story that was better, in your opinion, than the five on the final ballot, your correct #1 vote on the ballot was "No Award", because the Best Short Story could not win.<br>
<br>
That's also my problem with the "read the packet and judge." It implicitly argues "the best five stories are here, pick one of them" and with the slate, I'm betting that nowhere near the best five are there. You should read stories you haven't read and judge, but the idea here is "We hope you haven't read anything else and buy the idea that these must be the best five because they are on the ballot."<br>
<br>
So, no, I don't buy the "read the packet and if you hate them all, then No Award." There are many valid reasons to No Award, such as:<br>

1) You think the category should not exist. I No Award Best Artist every year, because we need to do Best Artwork, not Best Artist, and Best Artist is a broken category that awards Body of Work, and the Chesleys do a much better job of honoring the artists in our field.  (No Award 1st, either rank or not, depending. I don't rank BA because I don't know the artists well enough.)<br>
<br>
2) You think the category is flawed by design or lack of nominees. I No Award Best Semiprozine every year because of this, though lots agree and there are active steps in progress to try to save the category. I like the idea, but the implementation is broken. (I just NA it. I hope we can fix it.) <br>
<br>
3) You feel the nomination/voting process has been tampered with, thus, it does not represent a fair view of the electorate. (In this case, NA #1, the rest blank is the only valid choice.) <br>
<br>
4) You feel that, while the five finalists are worthy, there is a better work that was eligible that did not make the ballot. (In this case, rank no award 1st and then rank the works)<br>
<br>
5) You feel that all the works are shite (In which case, rank No Award 1st and rank nothing else.)<br>
<br>
(The difference -- 4 says "The best work isn't there, so No Award should be given, but if an award is given it should go to X, then Y, then Z. The latter says No Award should be given, and nobody should get it even if it is.) <br>
<br>
6)  You feel that two are worthy, one is the best, and three are shite. (Rank the best 1, the other one 2, No Award 3, and do not rank the rest. There are arguments about this, I write this from the view that the only thing that matters is the first place vote. If you care about who comes in lower places, then rank the shite after No Award.)<br>
<br>
7) You just want to watch the world burn. (Okay, that's not really valid, but it's your money. Rank however you want.) <br>
<br>
In short: No, I don't accept "Just read the damn stories and rank them." The Hugos are about the *Best*, not the Best on the Final Ballot. While the nomination process is supposed to try to get the best onto the final ballot, it can fail, and when it does, No Award is the tool we have to use. <br>
<br>
Brad Templeton noted something very valid -- the Hugos are not an election, they are a survey. We are trying to survey all of WSFS fandom to find out what, in aggregate, we think is the Best X. When 200 outside people jump in and alter the slate, they've broken the survey, just as many other surveys have been broken by collusion. <br>
<br>
And the correct thing to do with broken surveys is to disregard the data.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011541" target="_self">12:25 PM</a>  on April 16, 2015

<br>
Yes, that is correct.<br>
<br>
I refuse to reward this.<br>
<br>
Maybe they *could* have gotten onto the short list on their own merits.  But I cannot be sure that they did not push off another story, equal in merit to theirs or more so, which would have gotten on in their place if not for actions I consider unethical.  In fact, I consider that very, very likely.<br>
<br>
And I refuse to say, "Well, what's done is done."  No.  This might have cost someone else a Hugo.  Someone the majority of voters would have wanted on the ballot.  Someone the majority of voters might have said should win.  All because a small minority of voters exploited a quirk of the rules and hijacked the nomination process.<br>
<br>
They don't get a Hugo for that, not with my vote anyway.  They don't get a Hugo that was stolen from someone else.<br>
<br>
If they are good writers, I hope they get on another year, not on a slate.

I didn't say Hugos didn't mean anything to people (for Pete's sake), and I find it hard to see how my comment could be read that way.  I was specifically disputing the statement that they are "the highest possible honor the science fiction world can bestow."  Zed's response that "the worst Nebula award winning novel I've read was much worse than the worst Hugo award winning novel I've read" is to the point, though of course it doesn't prove anything about the overall preponderance of merit.  I don't have anything invested in my idea, but if you want to argue with it, argue with it and not a straw man.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/14752" target="_self">languagehat</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011702" target="_self">2:14 PM</a>  on April 16, 2015

		<a name="6011703"></a><div class="comments"><i>Actually, here's a question for probably eriko as resident guru - is there anything preventing the publicization of the nominees and vote totals? </i><br>
<br>
By rule, they're not published until after the award ceremony. The intent is to not let the nomination vote pre-judge the final ballot. Nominees are listed on the ballot in fixed order (usually alphabetically, other systems have been used) not by number of nominations, and there are many cases where the most popular work by nomination total did not win. <br>
<br>
However, usual practice is only the top 15 are listed, to save paper and embarrassment for the legions of 1 and 2 nomination works. One of the things that happens at the Worldcon is the "H" issue of the newsletter<sup>*</sup>, where the front page has the winners and the vote details, and the back has the nomination details. This is also when we normally find out about withdrawn nominations. Historically, you didn't announce you'd withdrawn except in the case of just *after* the ceremony where you'd announce a blanket withdrawal from consideration, here, you were also trying to prevent even being nominated. Examples of that: Michael Whelan as Best Artist, Kaja and Phil Foglio in Best Graphic Novel, a moved that saved the nascent category IMHO, and so on.<br>
<br>
I recall a case where the nomination slate was announced and a nominee comes forward and says "Oh, shit, I'm not actually eligible, sorry," and cases where the nominee was contacted before the announcement and withdrew but this year's pattern of publicly announcing withdrawals, and withdrawing after the nominations were out, is all very new, just one more oddball factor in this very strange year. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* The At-Con newsletter is numbered, indeed, nowadays it's "watermarked" with that number, first done by Chaz Boston Baden at Chicon 2000. Since you have all the data for the Hugos beforehand, the Hugo issue is often printed before the con (and occasionally offsite) and kept locked up, so it's gained the tradition "number" and watermark of "H" since you don't know what number in the newsletter sequence you'll be on when the ceremony announces the last award and the embargoes lift. <br>
<br>
Having walked around with that disk in my pocket (and that should pretty much give you an idea of when that was, given that it was "a disk in my pocket") I can tell you there are about a dozen to two dozen people at the Worldcon on day one who know who won -- the Hugo sub com as a whole, the newsletter and web chief heads, often the chair, whomever is involved with the Hugo ceremony who's in charge of the envelopes, whomever actually makes and handles the physical awards themselves, and whomever's in the press office getting the embargoed press release out to the press. There are a number of people in the press who know about this time as well, the "embargo until" rules are well established there and work well enough that when they don't work, that's newsworthy in and of itself.<br>
<br>
As the con progresses, select web staff and newsletter staff also find out as the web pages are prepared offline and the H issue is run off. It's a newsletter point of pride to be right outside the ceremony with hot-off-the-press H issues, because there are lots of people in the house who want to see the numbers. Sometimes, the web staff will be posting the awards as a play-by-play (I did that in 2000) since each award is unembargoed the moment the card is read in front of the ceremony, plus we're generally webcasting the ceremony anyway. <br>
<br>
It's interesting to compare this to the Oscars, where remarkably only two people know who the all the winners. Even in the counts, the ballots are deliberately unevenly sorted and handed to separate tellers, so that no teller can get an idea of who won based on their stack, which would, if they spilt the ballots randomly, be a fair sample of the actual vote. Only the two officers who sum up all the tellers know the true totals. They are given two full sets of cards with all the nominees by the Academy, and after they add up the numbers, they put the winning cards in the envelopes, and destroy the rest of the cards and ballots. They then put one set each into two brief cases, and each takes one of them in a separate car to the theatre. They literally stand just offstage, and when cued, show the outside of the envelope to the cuer, who confirms it is the right envelope, then they hand to the presenter/runner as they walk onto the stage. <br>
<br>
But getting early word of an Oscar is a much bigger deal than our little award. So, we just trust the people not to tell, and if you did tell, well, we'd apologize to everyone, and then we'd *never* trust you with that information again.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6011703" target="_self">2:15 PM</a>  on April 16, 2015

		<a name="6011729"></a><div class="comments">You know ... I feel this very long Hugo thread is sadly lacking in discussion of the Hugo nominees I *will* be voting on.  So I'm going almost entirely puppy-free (and hopefully spoiler-free) for a bit to do some reviews and criticism and chit-chat, dammit!<br>
<br>
My copy of The Goblin Emperor hasn't yet arrived in the mail (and will have to wait until I finish Beukes' Zoo City, and then I promised my sweetie I'd read Hardinge's Fly By Night next so we can talk about it, so even if it comes soon it'll have to wait for this weekend.)  So ... more on that later.<br>
<br>
Ancillary Sword felt in many ways like the second book of a trilogy -- which is what it is, after all -- and seemed to be setting a lot of pieces into place for the next book.  In some ways, that means that how they are resolved will determine how I feel about it, which means the book doesn't stand as well on its own as the first one.  This isn't a criticism, per se, but could be a consideration given that the book is up for the award and not the series.  Setting up the big things also meant a lot of the forward motion in this book came from things that were often smaller, more local, and more personal than in the first.  I do think it was all done with excellent writing, and wouldn't mind at all if it won the Hugo, but I will admit it didn't blow my mind the way the first book did, at least not standing on its own.  We'll see if Goblin Emperor DOES blow my mind, I guess, certainly I've heard some raves about it ...<br>
<br>
The Day The World Turned Upside Down initially didn't work at all for me because I started by taking the story literally.  Once it became apparent (to me at least) that it was meant to be taken as a metaphor, that the events of the plot were not "things actually happening" so much as commentary on a state of mind, I started liking it considerably more.  So I've warmed to it.<br>
<br>
For Wesley Chu, I'm guessing I should read The Lives of Tao?  Should I put that on the to-get list?  (Not sure yet exactly how the "packet" works, or if Campbell award nominees are even included in it ...)<br>
<br>
I haven't yet read Saga Volume 3, but have liked what I've read of Saga so far.  Haven't gotten to Sex Criminals: One Weird Trick either.  Both are waiting over to my left on the "to read" shelf.<br>
<br>
Rat Queens: Sass and Sorcery, I liked less than I thought I would.  I thought it was fine, but so many people were raving about how awesome it was that I expected more.  It, well, reads to me like a lot of D&amp;D campaigns I've played.  Fun ones, but still.<br>
<br>
Ms. Marvel: No Normal, on the other hand, TOTALLY lived up to how much everyone was raving about it!  I read it a couple of nights ago and it was awesome!  I've got to say that Saga and Sex Criminals have a pretty high bar to clear here.<br>
<br>
A lot of the other stuff I'll have to familiarize myself with a bit more.  Julie Dillon would obviously have to be a pretty bad artist for her not to get my vote, and same for Journey Planet for Fanzine, but while I assume that's not true I still want to check them out.  I'll need to look at all the fan artists' stuff, and give both Tea And Jeopardy and Galactic Suburbia Podcast a listen ... For Semiprozines, Lightspeed has been doing stellar work, but I don't know much about Beneath Ceaseless Skies or Strange Horizons so obviously need to check them out before I decide ...<br>
<br>
Oh, and of course Laura J. Mixon got nominated for Best Fan Writer for her epic expose on Requires Hate.  Wow, that's certain to be the most controversial topic at the Hugos this year!<br>

I wished Lives had been better. It's a fun, light premise and Chu's a decent writer. But I didn't really like the last half. His jokes fell flat (for me, ymmv) and even though so much of the story centers around his main character, (Roen, not Tao) he still felt thinly sketched.<br>

Well, look: VD is one of the more repulsive people whom I've had the displeasure of encountering in the wild, but I'm not sure that I would say that he's comparable to Hitler. Godwin and all that, and while he might advocate acid attacks, I haven't seen anything to suggest that it's anything but pathetic talk.  But in that metaphor, the Sad Puppies are FDR and Churchill, and the Rabids are Stalin and who does that make Hitler?  Because clearly, teaming up with Stalin was probably not something that FDR or Churchill would have done in the absence of an existential threat to civilization. So is he saying that the SJWs are Hitler?  Because yeah.

<em>I started Sad Puppies a few years ago. My goal was to demonstrate that the awards were biased, represented the likes of only one small part of fandom, and that authors with the wrong politics who got on the ballot would be attacked.  All of that has been demonstrated rather conclusively. </em><br>
A BIG LIE that puts him smack dab in the same bucket with Vox Day.<br>
The problem with the Hugos is that for its claims to be "the award of the Fans", it drew a tiny percentage of Fandom into its selection process. The Sad Puppies was always representative of a small, reactionary and regressive part of SF Fandom who didn't like the direction the entire field was going. The goal was to "return control" to their clique and they are succeeding. <br>
<br>
I've <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#5998160">stated before</a> that I expect the Puppies to sweep the awards. While a small clique, they are also the most motivated clique... SFWs are never as organized as the Injustice Warriors, and if the pizza parlor in Indiana can get $840,000, then the Puppies can get enough $40 contributions to overwhelm all else (and that record 1300 from 'all sides' is only the start... I expect Vox or one of his more 'reasonable' allies to get an appearance on FoxNews that will open up the floodgates from thousands of right-wingers who otherwise ignore SF). The Hugos will be the Award for the Racist, Sexist "SF Traditionalists" from now on (and Worldcom needs to separate themselves from the whole thing ASAP). Fortunately, there are other awards, and new ones that can be created and named after someone more relevant than Hugo Gernsback - I still suspect the founder of an old sci-fi magazine might not disapprove of this direction for his namesake.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012013" target="_self">4:07 PM</a>  on April 16, 2015

<br>
Even if one doesn't want to go that far, Churchill and FDR didn't "wind up" on the same side as Stalin, they weighed the alternatives and decided that they'd rather ally themselves with Stalin to fight Hitler. Correia is expressly saying that the portion of fandom that voted for the Hugos before the Puppies started yapping <em><strong>were the Nazis</strong></em> in this scenario.

		<a name="6012159"></a><div class="comments"><i>I've stated before that I expect the Puppies to sweep the awards</i><br>
<br>
I don't think they will. I don't think they'll win a single one, in fact. <br>
<br>
The reason is the voting system. The nominations are *easy* to steal. 200 people nominating a slate can control it, because it's fundamentally a fifth-past-the-post vote, and in terms of bad effects, there are very few worse voting system.<br>
<br>
But the final ballot is STV. So, if you wanted to vote for one of the non-puppies, you are not risking giving the vote to a puppy later. Just rank No Award below them -- if your chosen candidate is eliminated, then your ballot goes to your #2 choice. Nobody wins until one person has over 50% of the votes. Then there's the 2nd test. Another election is held, just the provisional winner vs. No Award. If No Award beats the provisional winner head to head, then No Award wins. The only way they can win is to get 50%+1 of the ballots at some stage of the process. <br>
<br>
There were already at least 5000 members of Sasquan before this whole sad business started, and you can bet most of them will be voting. Those 1300 that joined since the announcement? They're mostly fans. They all jumped in after the announcement. <br>
<br>
Those 200 that stole most of the ballot slots don't stand a chance against the 5000 who were already there and the 1300 that have joined since. EVEN if every single one of those 1300 is puppy, that's 1500 vs. 5000, and pretty much nobody else is voting for them. <br>
<br>
And those 1300 are not all puppy. Those 1300 are almost all fans. Trust me on that, but when the next membership list comes out, you'll be able to see it, because the names will be there.<br>
<br>
The question isn't "Will the puppies win." The last time an RP made the ballot, he came in dead last, behind No Award. He will not be alone. The question will be how many Hugos will be awarded this year. My feeling is 4. I'm voting 0. <br>
<br>
Seriously. <a href="http://sasquan.org/member-numbers/"> Look at the chart</a>. They had about 2000 at the vote, and about 800 converted to attending. By next April, they had 1200 attending, and the same 1200 supporting. Come September 2014, they picked up another 800 attending, this was people at Loncon 3 buying in for next year's Worldcon. All the way to February, 2015, the supporting number stay bascially flat, 1200 members, and the attending categories slowly grow as people buy in.<br>
<br>
The, early February we see supporting jump by about 800 people. Why? Hugo nominations open. And this is when the puppies buy in to nominate the RP slate. We know there wasn't 800 of them, if there were, the minimum to nominate would have been much higher. There were fans who bought in at the same time -- we see that every year.  <br>
<br>
Now we're at 2000 supporting. That number holds all the way until last week, which is the first datapoint reported *after* the ballot announcement. That's where we see supporting jump to 3300. <br>
<br>
But the important thing to remember is the 4000+ who were already in before Hugo nominations were open. None of them are RP. Most of them are long time Worldcon fans, esp. the 2000 who voted site selection back in London. <br>
<br>
If half of them vote, that's 2000 votes alone that RPs have to overcome before they're now even. And I'll bet we see 5000+ voting.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012159" target="_self">5:19 PM</a>  on April 16, 2015

The assumption there is SP and RP had identical support, and I think that's very much an unwarranted assumption.

<br>
It looks to me like there were about 300 "combined slate" puppy votes, with about 150 coming from each one.<br>
<br>
Last year, 150 votes would have swept Novella, Novelette, Short Story, Related Work, and Long Form Editor.<br>
<br>
And in fact, that's what we've seen this year -- it isn't just the "combined" ones that were on both slates that got on.  Ones which were just on one slate or the other also got on.<br>
<br>
This year, if the two puppy slates had been completely different, with no overlap whatsoever, they almost certainly still would have swept most of the categories they did.  Even with each wielding somewhere around 8 to 9 percent of the total vote.  That's how much slate voting distorts the kind of process the Hugo nominations use.<br>
<br>
There are ways to mitigate that, but a 3/6 nomination process, by itself, will not work.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012675" target="_self">6:47 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

(To correct myself, it was probably more like 150 Rabid Puppies and ~125 Sad Puppies.  When Rapid-Puppy-Only went against Sad-Puppy-Only stories in the short story category, the Rabid Puppies won - it went Combined/Combined/Combined/Rapid-Puppy-Only/Rapid-Puppy-Only.  But as soon as Annie Bellet withdrew her Combined story, it was a Sad-Puppy-Only story that was next in line.  I think the general point still stands.  It's very likely that had Rabid Puppies not existed and given no votes, Sad Puppies would still have swept that category, and vice-versa.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012688" target="_self">7:08 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

		<a name="6012727"></a><div class="comments">Personally, I think I favor reduced nominations-per-person, an expanded ballot, and adding a third stage to the current two-stage system.<br>
<br>
Something like --<br>
<br>
Stage 1: Everyone gets 3 nominations to a long list of 16.  Slates can get stuff on, but even four or five competing slates with no overlap aren't going to take up the whole long list.<br>
<br>
Stage 2: From that list, everyone gets 2 nominations to a final list of 7.  You could attempt to slate at this stage, but (1) it is MUCH harder for a slate to work when the rest of the votes are concentrated on selections from a long list instead of "everything that is", and (2) you'd still need four slates to totally cover everything.<br>
<br>
Stage 3: Hold the traditional ranked instant run-off voting (or whatever the actual technical name for it is) for the winner.<br>
<br>
I realize that adding a long list stage means more expense and effort, but I really think it would be worthwhile to examine how much; the return might be worth it.<br>
<br>
I know there are other suggestions out there to skip the middle stage and simply have an expanded final list (simply putting on everything that gets above a certain percentage according to a mathematical model), but I don't see how that can work to fairly let in stuff that's not-on-slates unless you're talking like ~10 items per category on the final list, which feels to me like it's starting to get pretty daunting for a "rank these works in order of preference" style vote.  (I picked 7 because it seemed like the highest plausible number to me, but for the mathematical model system, it'd still be 7 picks from a "vote on everything and that's what you get" system and therefore would still be pretty easy to slate a big chunk of it if you were so inclined.)  If I'm wrong about that, I'd be happy to hear why.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012727" target="_self">7:56 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

		<a name="6012734"></a><div class="comments"><i>There are ways to mitigate that, but a 3/6 nomination process, by itself, will not work.</i><br>
<br>
Of course not.<br>
<br>
*NOTHING* short of a single nominee system (which has other bad effects) or non-public nominations prevents slate voting. Our current electoral system is basically built around party voting, which is *TA DAH* slate voting.  But the current system with the Hugos, where you nominate five for five slots is *incredibly* vulnerable.  If you can get 500 lockstep nominators, you will own every category completely and utterly, and 200 nominators owns most of them, as we've see this year.<br>
<br>
The prevention before was not legislation, it was social. The prevention in the future will not be purely legislation, but it may partly be. But anything that forces a slate to split reduces the effectiveness of a slate by forcing it to spread its effort, which makes it more closely match the normal nomination pattern. Combine that with just the awareness that we'd better be nominating and voting if we want to keep them, and that may well be enough. We may not be able to overcome a 200 nominator block in novella, but we may be able to overcome two 100 nominator blocks or 3 66 nominator blocks trying to sweep the ballot. They could just focus on 3 or 2 slots, but then the other slots are free and clear. <br>
<br>
Or, maybe we have to give up on public nominations. I can see building a jury system. WSFS already has a standing committee (the Mark Protection Committee) and I can see a system where the various Worldcons nominate a slate of jurors, say, oh, 15 each to serve for 5 years. That gives you 75 jurors doing the nominations. It's a very different model than the current one -- but it's workable and completely slate resistant, and it would still end in a popular vote amongst WSFS members for the final winner.<br>
<br>
<i>Personally, I think I favor reduced nominations-per-person, an expanded ballot, and adding a third stage to the current two-stage system.</i><br>
<br>
If you really want to break slates, you make it so that you cannot nominate in the second stage if you nominate in the first. If you try to slate, you have to split your slate right from the start.<br>
<br>
But I can tell you right now that's too complicated to get past the business meeting right now. If this keeps getting worse, they might accept that, but right now, the proposals that stand the best chances are going to be the ones with the smallest effect, the least side effects, and the least added work for the Hugo Administrators.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012734" target="_self">8:08 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

I don't think that was his point.  He wasn't saying that the awards <em>should</em> follow sales numbers or that they <em>do</em> follow sales numbers.  Instead, what he was saying was that they <em>don't</em> follow sales numbers, with a carve-out for the Oscars which he sees as being driven to a certain extent by sales.  And then he goes on to describe why that might be the case.  But, unlike Correia et.al., he doesn't seem upset by the gap between sales and awards.

<br>
I think that's more about the argument that the Hugos are structured for the SF/F market of the 1950s and 60s rather than how people are writing today, though. <br>
<br>
(Which is something I hadn't thought about before but now that he brings it up it's head-slappingly obvious. In such a sequel-focused market, how do we get away from awards that only look at isolated works? Why are there still three short fiction awards and only one for novels when there are a billion times more novels than short works now? How do you deal with a writer like Sanderson, who's undeniably successful but writes in <i>meta</i>series? These are not easy questions but they're things the WSFS should certainly think about.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/130801" target="_self">Holy Zarquon's Singing Fish</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012945" target="_self">11:03 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

		<a name="6012976"></a><div class="comments">I think Flint makes a good point about the various literary categories, and how the focus on short fiction (3 of 4 categories) doesn't really represent the market anymore. I wouldn't mind seeing it simplified to "Best Long Form" and "Best Short Form" as is done with Dramatic Presentation categories.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://uchronia.net/sidewise/">Sidewise Awards</a> do this. Note: they are presented at Worldcon but are not Hugos or WSFS-affiliated.<br>
<br>
The Sidewise categories are split at 60k words. Re: Series - <blockquote><em>If a book is part of a series, it must be able to stand on its own to be considered. If it is part of a serial novel — a series in which the storyline is continuous and no volume can stand on its own — <b>the complete serial novel will be considered when the final volume is published</b>.</em></blockquote><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/152174" target="_self">zakur</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012976" target="_self">11:28 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

<br>
Well ... one fix would be, instead of the weird "you can nominate a series for best novel" thing that exists now, just make a separate award for best series.<br>
<br>
Call a series any set of novels that are marketed as a series or are otherwise clearly parts of a single narrative.  You could say it's for any series completed in the past year, or you could say (to allow for ongoing works or the possibility of uncompleted series), any series at least two books in length with one book published in the previous year.  In either case, any which have had any part (book, or set of books) previously nominated would be ineligible.<br>
<br>
I mean, they already kind of *do* it, this would just split it off into another category.  I bet it would pass eriko's "can you show me 5 worthy works each year" rule easily.<br>
<br>
(And, hey, as long as I'm changing all the Hugo rules here on Metafilter, can I ask that all people with my name be given free chocolate and hugs as part of the award ceremony?  Because since I'm gonna have no effect whatsoever, I should make it good!)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6012988" target="_self">11:34 AM</a>  on April 17, 2015

		<a name="6013166"></a><div class="comments"><cite>Wait MartinWisse isn't Eric Flint a pinko commie former labor organizer? When was he whining about conservative SF being neglected?</cite><br>
<br>
Yes, he was, but the only difference it made in his fiction was that the good guys with guns were union members rather than libertarians like with most of his fellow Baen writers. And to be honest,  Flint never was as big a crybaby as the current crop of Baen hacks, rather more into the whole "only sales count" as a measure of quality. <br>
<br>
Which leads him to some strange places, as in <a href="http://www.ericflint.net/index.php/2015/04/16/some-comments-on-the-hugos-and-other-sf-awards/">the third part of his explanation of why the Hugo Awards are out of step with the average sf reader</a> that  kyrademon just linked. <br>
<br>
Because he is correct that long before the Puppy shenanigans, the Hugos already had problems with keeping its finger on the pulse of science fiction, the problem isn't that the people nominating and voting have too refined tastes. Just look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel">list of winners and nominees for the best novel</a>. Look at the most recent pre-Puppy winners, from 2001 to 2013 it's J. K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Robert J. "Canada's most successfull living sf writer" Sawyer, Lois McMaster Bujold, Susanna Clarke, Robert Charles Wilson, Vernor Vinge,  Michael Chabon, Gaiman again, Paolo Bacigalupi, Connie Willis, Jo Walton and John Scalzi.  Of those arguably only the Clarke can be considered "arty" rather than "popular".<br>
<br>
The dichotomy between sales and award worthiness or critical appeal is wrong on the face of it, or <cite>Dhalgren</cite> wouldn't have been a million seller.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013166" target="_self">1:17 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

Thanks for that. One of the panelists, Brittney Le Blanc, does a good job summing up the problem with GG, MRA, etc. disruption:<blockquote>It’s disappointing that they weren’t there to have a conversation or to listen to what we, and members of the audience, were saying. They wanted to stand up and have their say, but not to listen or try to understand the points of view other people in the room had.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/99375" target="_self">audi alteram partem</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013279" target="_self">2:28 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

Good. I was wondering. <br>
<br>
Conference / Show / Expo staff typically walk the floor each day prior to show openings, to make sure no exhibitor is breaking either show or venue rules. They're primarily looking for egregious violations that can cause bigger headaches. Because the last thing you want to have to deal with is a big problem when the place is flooded with attendees. <br>
<br>

Even the mosque wasn't the thing that got people pissed off at Moon: it was her assertion that Muslims can't be good Americans, that there was a fundamental conflict between the two.  <br>

Which, of course, is exactly what was said about Catholics once upon a time, and is no more true now than it was then.<br>
<br>
She also bungled the business: she allowed comments, and then deleted them all, and it was a whole thing. Badly managed, but the end result was merely being disinvited as GOH at Wiscon.

They don't want to return SFF to the 1950s, they want to go back to the 1850s, with them as plantation owners. (But then, as the piece explains, there wasn't that much difference between the 1850s and 1950s after all)<br>
<br>
The "Culture War" is a one-sided affair; it is only those who are trying to destroy everything but their sacred White Male Christian culture who are really fighting. That is why I still feel that the SonsOfBitches can succeed in making the Hugo's "their" awards this year, and if not this year, they eventually will. And the Calgary Expo attack is just the beginning. These SocialInjusticeWarriors will probably achieve a full takeover of at least one Con (probably one without a clear anti-harassment policy) within a year or two. The only thing holding them back is the fact that some of their organizers, like the HorrableBadgers, are first and foremost lining their pockets with anything more than their actual costs from the contributions of the gullible.

		<a name="6013576"></a><div class="comments"><em>The #CalgaryExpo is depressing as hell.</em><br>
<br>
I'm not going to look at the hashtag, but just share my little corner of things today.  This afternoon I had to go represent my organization at a function at the University of Calgary.  As luck would have it, the LRT route between the office and the campus took me right past the location of the Expo.<br>
<br>
I got on the train, which was reasonably crowded.  Nearby were two young ladies (I would guess high school? I don't know, I'm lousy at guessing ages of teenagers), both wearing T-shirts from the expo and both with their passes, obviously on their way.  I wasn't eavesdropping, but I heard one of them talking excitedly about her "character, who is going to be this half-orc ranger, but with -" I have no idea if they were talking about a tabletop RPG or a computer game or a story/comic she is working on or whatever.  But it was cool.  And I'm standing there thinking how neat it is that I'm on a train with two teenage girls who are apparently into the same stuff I was (and still am) into as a teenage boy.<br>
<br>
So we get to the stop where you'd get off if you were going to the Expo, and I watch them leave and am smiling about it, and then this other young lady walks past, dressed up as Daenerys Stormborn as a Dothraki rider, complete with stuffed dragon stitched to the shoulder of her costume (and I bet the real Dany wished she had the sunglasses during her sojourn in the desert).  And so I'm thinking about how awesome that is.  Getting on the train is a lady about my age, not in costume, but with her Comic-Con pass around her neck, talking on her phone about how she just has to go visit her daughter for a bit. And then I get on campus, and I pass two other young women (both also visible minorities) on their way to the train, dressed in Avengers costumes.<br>
<br>
And I realized that if there's a battle on for the heart and soul of SF&amp;F fandom, it's over.  Because nothing I saw this afternoon on the way to Expo looked like me, but I knew I would be happy to sit and chat with any of them about what they liked and what they didn't like, and I wouldn't care too much if we didn't like the same things. Because I got happy because I saw them happy, going off to this event.  And I'd be happy to hear about what resonates for them in the stories they love. I'm happy to recognize other fans.  Happy to realize that they probably aren't looking for the same stories and movies and things that I am, because that means the market is supplying things for both me and them...and that is a good thing, because it means I get a chance to see more and do more and experience more.  I might not like all of it, but that's ok.  Anime isn't my thing, and it probably never will be, but that's fine. More power to them, and I know that some of the stuff I do love likely has anime influences in it that I may never grasp and understand. They are the richer for it.  I know very little about the Marvel Universe, but by Grabthars Hammer I have a ball at those movies and I am very glad that there was enough of a fanbase out there for them to get made in the first place.  I am the richer for it.<br>
<br>
From the business side, the audience is larger than ever.  The audience is more diverse then ever.  They will want stories and media of all kinds that speak to them, speak about them, and include them. The market will follow them...and the market will also continue to produce the more traditional "rocket ships and laser guns" stuff as well, because it has fans too.  <br>
<br>
I know this is all anecdotal, but yeah.  <br>
<br>
<em>Once there we will start distributing the totalitarian message that nerd and gamer culture is… perfectly wonderful just as it is and should be left alone to go it’s own way.</em><br>
<br>
You know what?  I agree.  It is a wonderful thing, and it should be allowed to go it's own way. The problem is that I see the way it is going and am filled with happiness because I see it trying to be more, trying to improve, trying to include everyone who identifies as a nerd and a gamer.  That's a culture I want to be a part of, a culture that believes we have to keep extending our reach, keep finding fresh ideas and ground to cover, keep challenging itself to be better.  Not one that attempts to say that it's continued evolution should be more of the same of how it's been.  Really, who needs to leave it alone?  Because I bet the answer to that question probably leaves out most of the people I saw today.  And I suspect it leaves me out, because as much as I grew up on the "traditional" SF&amp;F of my day, that doesn't stop me from being a critical consumer and pointing out ways and ideas that things could be better.<br>

<br>
I think it's because the end goal of 'inclusive' is, as stated above by others, not actually the full goal, because the perception is that it's impossible to be inclusive with everyone. The reach is not for the joy in sharing common interests with all type of people. The reach is for some of those people to be <em>gone.</em> <br>
<br>
Like, for example: people aren't saying, "Hey, Orscon Scott Card has some shitty ideas. Oh well, what do we care? There are also people with great ideas." They're saying - whoa, boycott his books.<br>
<br>
The very second comment in this thread is an outraged, "Who nominates human scum?" with the implication being that the authors' views <em>however shitty</em> should mean that they should not be awarded for their novels. <br>
<br>
And that's the thing, right?

I wouldn't be a fan of that.  I think some people here might want to quantify it a little differently.  How many black women, gay men, and Muslims are you driving away by honoring bigots?  That has to be an important part of how we evaluate it, I think.  When we aren't talking about government censorship, private organizations should be free to make this sort of calculus on their own and other groups can go in different directions if they want.  <br>

<br>
I think GRRM is right in that we are not yet at the point where having conservative views is a complete Hugo-killer, not even close. The idea that the SJW contingent has completely shut out the Hugos to everyone not in complete lockstep is an error.<br>
<br>
However, I suspect we are close to, if not already at, the point where a conservative or considered conservative <em>work</em> cannot win at the Hugos. (For example - take Harry Turtledove, who is still producing incredible work. Hugo and Nebulas in the late 90s. He has not had any work-shittening near death experiences to my knowledge - but I haven't seen nominations in the last decade or so, and it may well be that things like Southern-sympathetic alternate history are no longer considered acceptable mainstream discourse).<br>
<br>
I also think we are already at the point where a vocal <em>social</em> conservative cannot win the Hugos. I absolutely think we are at that point. I think that the chance that someone who, say, signed an amicus brief for Prop 8 or something, could win on the ballot is virtually nil, even if their science fiction crawled down from the heavens with words so shining they burned when you read them.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013638" target="_self">7:36 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

OK, I'll bite.  In the case of awards, yes, I would think that was a bad outcome.  I believe I am on record in this thread as saying that I think Orson Scott Card, whom I think is a terrible human being, deserves his Hugos.  An award given for artistic merit should be based on artistic merit.<br>
<br>
Panels are a more complicated thing.  If someone's outspoken opinions include "people the organizers would like to welcome to this convention are lesser human beings", I am not at all sure that convention organizers deciding not to pick that person as a representative of the public face of the convention is quite the same issue.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013639" target="_self">7:36 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

<br>
When Martin Luther King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Bull Connor objected that the Nobel Committee was "scraping the bottom of the barrel" to come up with honorees who agreed with their ideology. Other white supremacists alleged it was a communist plot.<br>
<br>
This is literally the same argument you are making. Do you feel bad for Bull Connor that he wasn't considered for national policing awards? Or an honorary degree from Howard? What right does he have to those honors?<br>
<br>
Being a racist IS an act of exclusion. There is no "But SJWs excluded us first." No. Racism, sexism, homophobia, that is exclusion. Tolerant people are not required to tolerate the intolerant, and it's the worst kind of sophistry to claim that if they don't allow intolerance, they are themselves intolerant.<br>
<br>
You are demanding that they be insulated from the repercussions of speaking their repugnant beliefs. Sorry, no. That is not how free speech works. You do not have a right to a platform beyond your own pen, and philosophers like Milton who laid the groundwork for free speech explicitly argued that part of the value of free speech was that people who were wrong would get ARGUED DOWN.<br>
<br>
Stop crying a river for Bull Connor and his ilk. Nobody's taking away the Sad Puppies' right to speak or vote or receive a jury trial. Just telling them they have no natural right to an award.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013644" target="_self">7:42 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

He's a competent writer (but not, I think, a <i>great</i> one), and while he sells consistently, he's basically been telling the same stories for the last twenty years.  That type of alt-history isn't generally considered to be strikingly original and award-worthy material.  (IMO: it's been a looong time since I read anything by him.)<br>
<br>
Also, and at risk of buying back into the whole log-rolling argument, Turtledove doesn't seem to play the social media game.  He doesn't cater his work or his promotion to the type of people who go to Worldcon, although I'm sure he does <i>some</i> promotion as part of his contracts.  <br>
<br>
So: is it bigotry that someone who writes something not a lot of Worldcon voters are into, and who doesn't reach out to Worldcon voters, doesn't get nominated for Worldcon awards?  <br>
<br>
Frankly, I think that has more to do with it than the fact that he portrays Southerners sympathetically.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013654" target="_self">7:53 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

What I do see is people naturally bouncing off work that doesn't respect their own understanding of the world.  I don't like books in which women only show up as madonnas and whores or books in which the only Asian person is the treacherous and deceitful political-enforcement officer (I'm looking at you, R. M. Meleuch).  I'm not going to hold those books up as representative of the best of the field, because I don't believe they <i>are</i>. (For one thing, that sort of bullshit is Bad Writing.  Racist and sexist stereotypes are <i>bad writing</i>, cheap and easy and stupid and not representative of how the world works.)<br>
<br>
But my choice to put the book down and walk away--that's not me punishing the author for being A Bad Person: that's me not liking the book.<br>

If the world has become a place where people don't naturally like books filled with homophobia and racism and misogyny, isn't that okay? And shouldn't writers who want to sell books then write books which are not filled with those things?<br>

		<a name="6013669"></a><div class="comments">Actually, I have a further point, corb. You keep saying, "But what if these REALLY GREAT stories aren't recognized because of the political beliefs of their authors?" as if the two are somehow separable, but that's a serious, fundamental falsehood in thinking about art. Art is inherently political, because it is (mostly) ABOUT something. It might not be about politics explicitly, but it's about people, or the natural environment, or our relationship to science. When you create or perform art, you make a window, a viewfinder, to show other people how you want them to view that little bit of the world. Art -- and especially literature -- is there to show, persuade, explain, inform -- to change people's minds, or affect their emotions, or broaden their intellects, or simply show them a different point of view, or reinforce a view they already hold. That is an inherently political act. The First Amendment doesn't just protect <em>political</em> speech but speech -- expression -- generally, because expression always has a political dimension. The clothes you wear say something about how you view the world and your place in it. The way you groom your eyebrows. The food you eat.<br>
<br>
Literary awards are never just about the author's technical proficiency with language; they are always, and always, also about what the art is ABOUT. Authors are not xerox machines. If you just want to award "really good English language skills" we could all write business memos or SAT essays (although they are still, of course, political in ways we don't always recognize). Art is also subjective -- even SAT essays. Human judgment and taste enters into it. It's not like an arithmetic problem where there's a correct answer. You can't complain that other people are failing to recognize your technical proficiency as a writer because they don't like the content or ideas -- it's all an inseparable part of the whole.<br>
<br>
And look, I appreciate more than most people what it's like to suffer for speaking out politically (after the past 18 months or so when I've suffered intense repercussions over a minor local political issue, which have been so bad I've considered changing my damn name so these people would leave me alone). It sucks when people disagree with you, and it double-sucks when you're targeted for your beliefs. But these aren't people sitting quietly in their homes bothering no one; they're authors publishing stories for the reading public, and then upset when the public has reactions to them. Nobody is forcing them to speak, or to make art, and when you do choose to speak out or make art, <em>people are going to judge you by that speech.</em><br>
<br>
I get it that the ground has shifted under them in terms of what's acceptable and taboo, but that is a story as old as humankind, and as old as art, and it is literally in Plato, and anyone making art for the public knows -- or should know -- that tastes shift, sometimes radically, and someone can be lionized, then mocked, then forgotten, then rediscovered, then disdained, then canonized, and that that process doesn't stop when you stop making art, or even die ... it just goes on.<br>
<br>
Authors who don't want the public to engage with their ideas <em>should not publicly release their art</em>, especially in a genre as idea-driven as SFF ... there are no bonus points in SFF for a photorealistic rendering of the world as it is -- it is explicitly a genre of ideas and imagination and alternatives -- such a "realism" that took no liberties with reality would not even qualify as SFF.<br>
<br>
So please stop saying that these authors should be recognized because their art is great as long as you totally detach it from their ideas. That isn't how art works. And awards are not a comprehensive catalog of "everyone doing pretty good work." They're a specific recognition, in a specific moment in time, by a specific group of people. Art is about ideas, not just technical craft. The two cannot be separated.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6013669" target="_self">8:15 PM</a>  on April 17, 2015

<br>
Sanderson does have some mediocre quality stuff out there so maybe keep an eye on that, but I've never really seen any bad politics seep into his writing.  There is a difference between being disliked for personal politics and being disliked for works of fiction based on offensive personal politics expressed in the work itself.<br>

But if you tell me that you (or you and Mr. Correia, or you and he and some other Sad Puppies) made judgment calls of your own from amongst the books and stories put forward by your readers... why, that would not be democratic at all.

And it's the Puppies' sworn goal to ensure that Ann Leckie doesn't match that this year. "Speaker for the Dead" beat "The Handmaid's Tale" for the Nebula, while Atwood's masterpiece didn't even get nominated for a Hugo but <em>L. Ron Hubbard</em> did. Please remember that the Sad Puppies have Doggie Daddies who had much of the responsibility for the Hugos' reputation as the "political SF award". (The SonsOfBitches are only reclaiming what used to be theirs)<br>
<em>the weight of history</em><br>

Geez, Wright, it's not like anybody with a brain who isn't deeply in denial doesn't see that you are all Addicted to Privilege, the Opiate of the White Male Bourgeoisie...<br>
<br>
And while I generally avoid Military SciFi like moldy meat*, I reluctantly picked up Scalzi's "Old Man's War" partly because its title and premise (recruiting retirees as humanity's soldiers) sounded exactly like "the Anti-Ender's Game"*, which it mostly was, and which I assume put him immediately on the True Believers' Enemies List even if he'd never written anything (gasp)Liberal(gasp) on his blog.  <br>
<br>
<small>*because it is, and my experience TRYING to read Ender's Game was partly responsible for that assessment.<br>
**also partly because I'd read his hilarious self-published "Agent to the Stars" and hoped for more such frivolity, which it had a little of - which is why I never touched the sequels and the only other book of his I've enjoyed since was "Redshirts".<small></small></small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6014262" target="_self">5:54 PM</a>  on April 18, 2015

<br>
Kessel's essay (which I've read more than once before) makes a strong point about the ways in which <em>Ender's Game</em> pushes a lot of male SF nerd buttons, especially teen &amp; adolescent buttons (like the entire concept of the bullied Victim Hero). Which certainly raises the question of whether the awards and reputation are because it's a 'genuinely good' work or because it's sort of the Ultimate SF Gary Stu Novel.<br>
<br>
Personally, while I thought the occasional Card stories I read in <em>Asimov's</em> back in the 80's were fine (but not groundbreaking or anything), I didn't get around to taking a whack at <em>Ender's</em> until I was well past 35, and I just couldn't get more than about halfway through. It didn't resonate with me at all, and I thought the structure was entirely too repetitive.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/145062" target="_self">soundguy99</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6014281" target="_self">6:16 PM</a>  on April 18, 2015

<br>
"I concur with the peacemakers, and urge my fellow fans to whom science fiction is beloved and for whom the Hugos still recall an echo of dignity to adopt a less belligerent posture.  Remove or silence those among you who see science fiction as a tool of social engineering and to whom entertainment is subordinate to political correctness, and I will break my saber over my knee and throw the shards in the sea."<br>
<br>
OK, first, dude, I don't think that "if everyone who disagrees with me would simply shut up forever then I would be happy to stop being so belligerent" is quite the mutual olive branch you believe it to be.<br>
<br>
Second, have you, um, read your recent work?<br>
<br>
Because when the writers of wham-bang action fiction complain about science fiction being used as a "tool of social engineering", at least it's coming from people who probably have no conscious intention of embedding political messages into their works.  When YOU complain about science fiction being used as a "tool of social engineering", it sounds like you are pointing your finger at yourself and saying, "STOP IT!  BAD ME!  BAD, BAD JOHN C. WRIGHT!

		<a name="6014974"></a><div class="comments"><i>Speaker for the Dead" beat "The Handmaid's Tale" for the Nebula, while Atwood's masterpiece didn't even get nominated for a Hugo but L. Ron Hubbard did.</i><br>
<br>
Okay, some history here. In the late 1980s Margaret Atwood quite legendarily did not write "children's stuff" like Science Fiction, so, despite the fact that she wrote one of the great works of the genre, fandom pretty much wrote her off. Since then, she's mellowed about that and we've mellowed about her and everyone acknowledges <i>The Handmaid's Tail</i> as one of the great work of SF, including Ms. Atwood. <br>
<br>
Also, in that time, Scott Card was nice guy famous for the "Secular Humanist Revival", which was an incredibly funny thing. <br>
<br>
If you're looking at what happened then by looking at those two authors now, it's hard to understand, but both of them had very different attitudes towards fandom in the 1980s/1990s than they do now, and the Hugos, being a fan based award, do have a "how much does this pro respect us?" factor in them. And, in 1987, Atwood didn't respect fandom at all, and Scott Card loved fandom. <br>
<br>
LHR's getting on the ballot has been mentioned before, it was a very classic stuff. He tried in 1986, but it was so obvious then that they rejected those ballots. They did a better job in 1987 and he made the ballot, came in last.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6014974" target="_self">2:19 PM</a>  on April 19, 2015

<br>
I recall that when he became president of SFWA, one of the first things he did was announce that he was declining all nominations for the Nebulas while he was in office. So, that might be a factor as well.<br>
<br>
But the idea of His Scalziness<sup>*</sup> being an award monster simply isn't true. He's gotten the Campbell, Best Novel for <i>Redshirts</i>, BRW for "Your Hate Mail Will Be Graded" and Fan Writer. That's it for the Hugos. No Nebulas, a minor award, and that's it. <br>
<br>
That's not an award machine. I don't get the idea that he owns the Hugos, because he doesn't even come close to doing so. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* I love this idea of "Each time The Scalzster is referred to, it must be by a new title", and decree it so.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6014986" target="_self">2:29 PM</a>  on April 19, 2015

		<a name="6015038"></a><div class="comments">So, to satisfy my own curiosity, I poked around (mostly on my own bookshelf but also a little online) to see if a "best series" Hugo would fit eriko's general requirement for a new Hugo category, which I interpret as, "Show me the five that have a chance of winning this year and then 6-10 MORE that are also Hugo-worthy."<br>
<br>
If we make a category which is "best series that FINISHED in 2014", after a little poking I found 6 that might make a ballot, although frankly a couple of those are iffy ...<br>
<br>
Grisha Trilogy, Leigh Bardugo<br>
Eternal Sky Trilogy, Elizabeth Bear<br>
Lynburn Legacy Trilogy, Sarah Rees Brennan<br>
A Land Fit for Heroes Trilogy, Richard Morgan<br>
Daughter of Smoke and Bone Trilogy, Laini Taylor<br>
The Southern Reach Trilogy, Jeff Vandermeer<br>
<br>
Finding more was hard, even looking around online.  But it's pretty obvious at a glance why - every last one a trilogy.  Longer series only finish once every blue moon, and ongoing series don't finish at all.<br>
<br>
If it's opened up, though, suddenly you can add a flood of options.  If it's "any ongoing series at least two books in length, never before nominated, with at least one book published in 2014" you can immediately add:<br>

And that's WITHOUT really looking around online, and I'm not listing another five or six I didn't think could be considered Hugo quality.  I'm pretty sure I could easily double the length of that list with a half-hour search.<br>

Frankly, though ... I don't see that ever happening.  The concept of voting for an uncompleted series would sound weird to most people -- honestly, it sounds kind of weird to me.

Likewise. Plus it doesn't seem right to have a series be permanently ineligible for the award after a single nomination, because it assumes that a series will never get better than the first installment fans think is really good.  The only way I can see an award for Best Series working is if it only applied to completed series, and the only way I can see <i>that</i> working is if it's not awarded every year. So maybe if there was an annual award for Best Installment In A Serialized Work and a triennial (or thereabouts) Best [Completed] Novel Series?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/130801" target="_self">Holy Zarquon's Singing Fish</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015067" target="_self">3:56 PM</a>  on April 19, 2015

<br>
The other natural way to do "best series" would be to make it an every-other-year award, or to award it in years that also have Summer Olympics (i.e., every four), so that this year, all series finished in 2013-2014 would qualify, or that in 2016, everything from 2012-2015 would qualify (2012 having awarded 2008-2011). Would two years expand it enough, or four make it too unwieldy?<br>
<br>
The other thing I'd like (and maybe this has already been considered) is turning Dramatic Presentation into "Dramatic Presentation -- EGOT-eligible" and "Dramatic Presentation -- Non-EGOT-eligible." That would sequester big-budget movies and television and so on off in their own category and allow weird YouTube series and podcasts and so on to get recognition. (Although I don't actually know what's EGOT-eligible and maybe it's not quite as elegant a delineator as I think, but you get what I mean!).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015079" target="_self">4:04 PM</a>  on April 19, 2015

		<a name="6015166"></a><div class="comments">I'm hesitant to endorse a Best Series award just because of the many, many, <em>fucking many</em> series I've read that the author took up again later on. Do we take back the Hugo if an author starts another "trilogy" in the same world with many of the same characters (e.g., Donaldson, Eddings, Saberhagen)? Does that second "trilogy" count as a new series for another Hugo? What if a new author does something with the property?<br>
<br>
The novel/novella/novelette/story breakdowns are based on word count, and they have to be like that because <em>Oh my dear gods</em> will nerds (myself included) parse the shit out of a thing if they get the chance. I feel like there would be some kind of uproar over "This isn't a <em>finished</em> series! See!" over and over again.<br>
<br>
Plus I feel that there would be a chilling effect on unfinished series in the big-time awards. Remember how <em>The Return of the King</em> was the only LOTR movie to win Best Picture, and <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> and <em>Chicago</em> were judged to be better that <em>Fellowship</em> and <em>Two Towers</em>, even though <em>come on</em>, Academy? I think the voters were clearly holding their breath to make sure that Jackson didn't fuck up the whole trilogy before they gave <em>any</em> of them any awards, and I worry that the same thing would happen to the Hugos.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/85249" target="_self">Etrigan</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015166" target="_self">4:50 PM</a>  on April 19, 2015

It's hardly unique to GamerGate.<br>
<br>
By having a "radical" wing that does scary things (insurgent activity, terrorism, etc) and a "political" wing that does nice, safe, moderate things (wear suits, interact with the government or King, dispense charity to the people), a movement can be more effective.<br>
<br>
Often the political wing disavows any connection to the radicals, while the radical wing denounces the political wing as quisling sellouts. (Sometimes those claims are even true - i.e. there may be no formal connection between the radicals and the moderates).<br>
<br>
In the GamerGate case, using a hashtag is all you need to "be a member", so the barrier to entry is nonexistent. Serious professionals can coexist with the most angry of crazy trolls.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/23656" target="_self">theorique</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015332" target="_self">8:48 PM</a>  on April 19, 2015

		<a name="6015473"></a><div class="comments"><em>Literary awards are never just about the author's technical proficiency with language; they are always, and always, also about what the art is ABOUT.</em> <br>
<br>
So this is the first of your really interesting points - that the award must be, itself, inherently political, because art is political, and that the judgement of the viewers is explicitly supposed to select for politics. And that's an argument I'm inherently sympathetic to. When I myself make art, it is often political in some ways. As you say, who you are and how you express yourself is always affected by how you see the world. And I do definitely agree that in our own reading preferences, the politics do affect what we want to read. Sometimes I have that reaction myself. For example - for personal reasons, I'm a pretty staunch anti-communist. As such, I find it really, really difficult to read and enjoy pro-communist or class-warfare literature - even when I recognize that it's literature that other people enjoy very much.<br>
<br>
But the questions we then need to ask are: is it possible to separate the assessment of a work's quality from the work's political climate? And is it desirable to do so?<br>
<br>
I don't think it's as impossible to separate the assessment of a work's quality with an assessment of the work's politics. Tolkien is generally regarded as a great fantasy writer - even though his work had some strong politics of anti-industrialization, rural fetishization, with some weird shit about class and war. Even people who hate those themes tend to acknowledge him as a great writer, and it's not merely for technical competency. He told a great and attractive story, even if people looked at it with sober eyes and saw problems. So I would say yes to the first.<br>
<br>
The question of whether or not it's desirable to separate a works' political context from its quality, particularly in the context of awards, is another thorny one. I think there's absolutely a time and a place for the recognition of works for political contexts. And we have those awards - we have the Tiptree, we have the Prometheus. We have ways to recognize works explicitly for the political context in which they are created in addition to their quality - and so I don't think we're starved for that. I think there's room for recognition of art purely for art's sake, because if not, what are we really awarding?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015473" target="_self">12:01 AM</a>  on April 20, 2015

<br>
And that is the goal of Vox Day and the Rabid Puppies. To save themselves the trouble of creating their own awards, instead to hijack a 60-year-old institution in order to recognize works explicitly for political context that THEY endorse.<br>
<br>
And what does Mr. Beale/Day endorse?
<blockquote><a href="http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2013/10/23/vox-day-the-talibans-attempt-to-silence-malala-yousafzai-was-perfectly-rational-and-scientifically-justifiable/">"[I]n light of the strong correlation between female education and demographic decline, a purely empirical perspective on Malala Yousafzai, the poster girl for global female education, may indicate that the Taliban’s attempt to silence her was perfectly rational and scientifically justifiable."</a></blockquote>

If there is any political opinion that should make one ineligible for any respectable award, that is it, and his expulsion from the SFWA should earn applause from anyone who treasures freedom, education  AND human life. But his manipulations have now earned him two nominations personally and eight more for content from his brand new publishing house (the most of any publisher this year and a feat rarely equaled). Any discussion of the relative politics of past awards is muted by the sound of jackboots led by a self-defined evangelical Christian who agrees with the Taliban on the issue of education for women.<br>
<br>
I want to be proven wrong, but I remain pessimistic that when a "fan driven" award attracts the attention of the truly fanatical extremists, that they will shout down and vote down anything not to their liking.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015513" target="_self">1:27 AM</a>  on April 20, 2015

It depends how badly the writer has shat the bed. We're only human beings.  If someone's going on about how it's natural to attack gay people with ax handles and tire irons when he's not calling a black woman an ignorant half-savage, and then reaches out to anti-woman hate group to stuff ballot boxes in a way that violates the spirit of a decades old popularity/merit award, then we're going to fold that into our judgement of their art. <br>
<br>
Like Hitler's watercolors, basically.<br>
<br>
If some social conservative is writing a kick-ass yarn but not actively vilifying or harassing people, the community doesn't seem to care about their politics.<br>
<br>
<em> I think there's room for recognition of art purely for art's sake, because if not, what are we really awarding?</em><br>

The feminist-flavored and post-colonial flavored stories that are getting hugo noms are getting attention because they're also good storytelling, on top of pushing the form by bringing in other ways of seeing the world.  e.g. Ancillary Justice.<br>
<br>
When you suggest that we need to work harder to overlook political climate and recognize art for art's sake, I'd really like to know if you're talking about a generic social conservative or someone who has behaved like Vox Day or <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/">Orson Scott Card</a>.

C'mon, are you still beating that drum?<br>
<br>
Hugos are voted on by members of the WSFS. All you're getting is a poll of what this year's members enjoyed this year (with a side-order of who does the best fan-pandering). Nobody, on any side, should be pretending it's anything more than that.<br>
<br>
(The fact that Iain M Banks never won a Hugo, I think, proves that it takes more than pure art, (I'm thinking of Feersum Endjinn and Excession particularly)).<br>
<br>
<em>Even people who hate those themes tend to acknowledge [Tolkien] as a great writer, and it's not merely for technical competency.</em><br>
<br>
*raises hand*. Can't stand Tolkien's mechanics and writing. No problem with the politics and love how his world's been built on and remixed (eg Stan Nicholls' Orcs books).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/19607" target="_self">Leon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015602" target="_self">5:50 AM</a>  on April 20, 2015

</em><br>
I think you've got the wrong end of this, corb, and you know I like you generally. A few things: we can't and shouldn't award "art for art's sake" if that means completely ignoring content. That's like trying to assess a painting while ignoring its subject matter. Sure, yes: brush strokes matters. But they have to add up to something, and the something they add up to matters, too. That doesn't mean we should always award it to liberals: often, the best work challenges our preconceptions, and that will mean that people like Card will win, too. But no one thinks these rabid puppies picks are so great as all that: the puppies think that we've jettisoned quality and that only politics matters.<br>
<br>
Second, it's just false that the work of women and minorities is somehow inferior on the art-for-art's-sake model, that is, inferior as craft and storytelling. It's largely the opposite that is true: to get uptake and popularity in a white male dominated industry, a woman has to be twice as good as her male competitors. A black man like Samuel R. Delaney has to be a literary genius to get just glancing attention from the majority of the fans. <br>
<br>
So when I say that, for instance, Karen Lord's <em>The Best of All Possible Worlds</em> is genius, I'm not saying it because the author is a black woman. I'm noticing, first, that the novel is knock-your-socks-off gripping storytelling, and that makes me wonder about the author who is--who'd have thought it--a black woman. <br>
<br>
The question we should ask is: why are so many of the minority novelists in sci fi and fantasy genius-level authors? Why are they almost all vitruoso? Where are all the mediocre black women in sci fi? Where's the schlocky Latina lesbian fantasy? In my view, it's not an accident that the midlist is full of straight white men: without the impediments of race and gender, it's easiest for the white man to survive in their mediocrity. But minorities can't: if they're not geniuses, they often fail completely.<br>
<br>
I think this is a good heuristic, generally. <em>The Three Body Problem</em> isn't a genius work<em> just because</em> the author is Chinese: it's the fact that it was so good in a land of a billion people that they bothered to translate it that suggests it may be better than your average midlist military sf. The Chinese have mediocre novelists, too... they just don't bother translating them into English. So that kind of selection effect serves as a good guide. <br>
<br>
There's no social justice warfare here, it's just good Bayesean reasoning: we live in a misogynistic and white supremacist and xenophobic and heteronormative society, so women and minorities have to be much better than white male competitors to succeed. It's not a fair status quo, at all--but while it lasts, you can certainly use it to find good reading materials.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36760" target="_self">anotherpanacea</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015626" target="_self">7:37 AM</a>  on April 20, 2015

<br>
That review pretty much sums up the first impression I had when I started reading that story, but I think it ignores what I think is a lot of eventual internal evidence that the story is taking place entirely in the narrator's head and none of the "events" are actually happening.  That considerably changed how I viewed it, for the better.<br>
<br>
Because of that, I will probably vote for above No Award.  However, I will admit it still didn't blow me away.<br>
<br>
Though so far, of the (admittedly few) things on the ballot I've read, not much other than Ms. Marvel: No Normal has truly done so.  I'm holding out hope for a number of the ones I haven't gotten to yet (Goblin Emperor, Three Body Problem, Sex Criminals 1, Saga 3, and The Lives of Tao, for example.)  And I'm looking forward to checking out the Semiprozines and the Fan Artists, some of the others.

<br>
The problem with the Hugo award for Best Artist is that they usually have no idea who created what art in a given year, so they're nominating names of artists they've seen before they liked. It's a body-of-work award, which the award was specifically *not* supposed to be. Even the ones that seem to be (Artist, Editor, Fan Artist, Fan Writer, Semiprozine, Fanzine) are supposed to for things created *that year*, not lifetime.<br>
<br>
But for Artist, and to some extent (how much is arguable) it's a lifetime body of work, and it often become Artist X winning until they pull themselves off the ballot. Thus the number of times Frank Kelly Freas, Micheal Whelan and Bob Eggleton have won it. Whelan and Eggelton pulled themselves off the ballot, FKF passed away, but now, it seems, we're cycling between Shaun Tan, John Picacio, and Julie Dilion. <br>
<br>
Not to say that Ran, Picacio, or Dilion are not incredibly talented or award worthy -- they are both. It may be, with the Internet, the voters are see much more recent work and the award is become much more based on recent work than body of work. Historically however, it's been a real problem.<br>
<br>
But SF/F Art has always been an important part of the genre, and WSFS has always wanted to have that award as part of its stack, despite the problems we've had with it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015758" target="_self">10:17 AM</a>  on April 20, 2015

<br>
Again -- the award is "Best X." If you can find one X that's better than the five on the ballot, you are perfectly justified in voting No Award over the five on the ballot. And it's in Your Humble Opinion.<br>
<br>
Just remember -- the scope is not constrained to the five on the ballot. This is one of the explicit reasons we put No Award on the ballot. WSFS recognizes that the nomination process isn't perfect and the Best X may not make the ballot.

		<a name="6015930"></a><div class="comments"><em>Second, it's just false that the work of women and minorities is somehow inferior on the art-for-art's-sake model, that is, inferior as craft and storytelling.</em><br>
<br>
To be clear, I have never, ever, endorsed this, and I don't even think the puppies (short Vox Day, because who the hell knows what gerbils are in his head) have said anything like this. In fact, most of the Puppies have talked about the work of women and minority writers that they do enjoy. I don't think anyone is saying "The problem with the ballot is that there aren't enough white people/TOO MANY LADIES" and I would probably giggle at anyone who was saying that.<br>
<br>
What this honestly reminds me a lot of (and I hate to keep bringing in parallels, but it seems to be the best way to understand this) is actually the actual military - which, much like early SF, was also a bit of a boy's club. I was in no way among the very first women who were a part of it, but I was definitely a part of the military before the military was really <em>used</em> to having women. And what I quickly found is that it wasn't that my fellow soldiers didn't like women or thought women were bad soldiers. It's that they thought<em> femme</em> women weren't good soldiers and they didn't respect women who presented as femme. If you came in as a hard-drinking, hard-smoking, fight-fighting badass, they didn't really care whether you had dangly bits or not. <br>
<br>
And so there was definitely this weird dichotomy, where I, being a little rough around the edges, was rapidly assimilated into my unit with no problems, but sometimes when there were women who were like 'you're all a bunch of rabid alcoholics, what the hell is wrong with you?' <em>they</em> would have difficulty integrating. <br>
<br>
And I think you see that with science fiction, especially looking at those SWFA forums. Nobody's saying, "What, how did all these POC and women get here?" They're saying, "Hey, hey, we're cool with the POC and women when they smoke cigars and talk about space with us, but we wish they'd stop talking about racism and ladyfeels all the time." It's the difference between the welcoming hand of assimilation and the welcoming hand extended even after a refusal to assimilate.<br>
<br>
And I am in no way suggesting that this view is unproblematic, because it definitely has its issues - but I don't think it's as simple as "they just don't like POC and women." Because they do, categorically do, like women and POC who act and think like them. Look at Annie Bellet's story, now published online - it's a story featuring a female POC, but a story where the female POC picks up a gun and shoots someone to defend herself and her boyfriend is a Soldier and the only time her POCness really comes up is in the naming scheme and occasional descriptions of her home life. It is basically a story that functionally could have been written by any of the OG Puppies. They welcome it and its assimilationist ways to the fold.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6015930" target="_self">12:22 PM</a>  on April 20, 2015

Honestly, what do you think all that moaning about SJW is a dog whistle <em>for</em>?<br>
<br>
The whole point of the sad puppies is that "politically correct" (sic) work keeps getting voted on the Hugo ballot that nobody who matters could like, that men of talent are kept off it due to a conspiracy of white knights pandering to minorities and females, that True Science Fiction has no chance against the affermative action driven slates of the SMOFs.<br>

Coming back to corb's defense of the Sad Puppies... I mean, basically, what you're saying is that as long as a woman or a POC doesn't ever acknowledge that they're a woman or a POC, and as long as they parrot the same viewpoints and beliefs as the Sad Puppies, then they'll be accepted.

<br>
It's less that I don't understand that, and more that I think it comes down to a fundamental difference on how acceptance happens and what acceptance means, which has actually really started to change a lot in the last thirty to forty years and has not fully spread to the majority of the US.<br>
<br>
When I was a kid, we still learned about America as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot">'The Great Melting Pot"</a> where the ultimate ideal was assimilation to a culturally homogenous whole. <blockquote>"The fusing process goes on as in a blast-furnace; one generation, a single year even-- transforms the English, the German, the Irish emigrant into an American. Uniform institutions, ideas, language, the influence of the majority, bring us soon to a similar complexion; the individuality of the immigrant, almost even his traits of race and religion, fuse down in the democratic alembic like chips of brass thrown into the melting pot."</blockquote>

And you see this kind of in the construction of whiteness as an identity when the majority of immigrants were European (a great book on this is How the Irish Became White), but the concept of assimilation has grown and changed to adapt to other racial and religious characteristics. The idea basically - the idea many of us were raised and acculturated into, even and maybe especially those of us who come from an immigrant background - is that you, too, can be an American, if you leave who you were behind and bring only enough flavor to make it interesting, without enough to be challenging. It is important to understand that for many people, across the country, this is their idea of what it means to be tolerant and noble and good - to forget people's identities once they have entered and come through the melting crucible.<br>
<br>
But in the last thirty or forty years, the concept of multiculturism has been pushing back, imported from other countries with different ideas - the 'salad bowl' or '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mosaic">cultural mosaic</a>' concept rather than a 'melting pot' - where you can maintain your identity as a member of the place from whence you came, without forfeiting being a Good American. You can keep your distinct qualities, and still be part of the whole. That is a concept that is embraced by a lot of the newer thinking on sociology overall - I'm not sure if it's made it into grade school textbooks yet, but it is a thing that's up and coming in how we think about being a coherent part of a whole as well. <br>
<br>
And it's important to remember, whichever place you come from, that this is a <em>controversy</em> - this is not a settled issue, even if it's settled personally for you or among your friends. And this I am beginning to think is at the heart of the conflict between Puppy and Non-Puppy. The Puppies are saying loudly - we will accept you if you assimilate to who and what we have always been! (whether or not that's true is a different argument, I think their perception at least is honest) And the Puppies are truly, truly confused as to why they're being perceived as racists. They are open to <em>all</em> assimilating members of <em>all</em> races! And you have the Non-Puppies, like you, saying 'Assimilation is bullshit! Take me as I am or not at all!'<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6016185" target="_self">2:37 PM</a>  on April 20, 2015

<br>
Can you clarify what you mean by "their perception at least is honest"?<br>
<br>
I think maybe you're saying that when the Puppies say they accept minorities, from the Puppy POV they're genuinely willing to offer up acceptance as they understand it, which is tacitly conditional upon assimilation. Even if many of us on the receiving end of that offer find the Puppies' understanding of acceptance to be hollow.<br>
<br>

Speculative fiction that doesn't rock the boat doesn't speculate very much. Soothing and reassuring repetition of the same archetypal stories is not what I think awards should be given for.

The more it proceeds, the more publicity it gets, the more it looks like they're winning -- but the part that doesn't show is that the more publicity the puppies get, the more opposition they create.<br>
<br>
Again, the business meetings in August will be contentious -- but the result will likely be a modification of the balloting process.<br>
<br>
If the committees are smart -- and I'm sure they are -- in addition to counting next year's ballots by the existing rules, they can test the proposed modifications by also counting the ballots according to the proposed mods.

I don't think they can truly say that with a straight face. They can say "we've already printed the paper ballots and were not reprinting them," and that's fine. <br>
<br>
I get why they want get the paper ballots out, doubly so after their epic fuckup with the paper nomination ballots. But fundamentally, anybody can withdraw anytime from now to close of balloting. If you vote for them, the admin just treats them as eliminated and moves to your next preference. If none, it becomes a no preference ballot and possibly changes the number of ballots needed to win - you need a majority of ballots with preference to win.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6016372" target="_self">6:22 PM</a>  on April 20, 2015

I'm a bit guilty of skimming some of the Sandifer text, but the conclusion about Monae (who's gotten onto the Tiptree recommended works list) stuck out for me:
<blockquote>But perhaps best of all, it (Electric Lady) is completely unconcerned with the likes of Theodore Beale. It does not seek their praise, which it would clearly never get anyway. It does not seek their antagonism, although it surely receives it. It does not consider itself for their consumption or use, and does not care one way or the other what they make of it. It simply loves itself, and its ideas, and the joy of them, and invites us to love them too.</blockquote>

I'm currently reading Karen Lord's <i>Galaxy Game</i>, and I'm struck by how she plays with the social construction of race, gender, and sexuality without ever seeking to justify it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017036" target="_self">1:08 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

<br>
I did, out of curiosity, look at who has won multiple times since 1995 in the Big Four Fiction categories, as a rough guide to Who Is Favored:<br>
<br>
Six Times: Connie Willis<br>
Five Times: Michael Swanwick<br>
Four Times: Vernor Vinge, Neil Gaiman, Ted Chiang<br>
Three Times: Allen Steele, Charles Stross<br>
Two Times: Joe Haldeman, Lois Bujold, Mary Robinette Kowal, Mike Resnick, Ken Liu, Bruce Sterling, Elizabeth Bear, James Patrick Kelly<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm seeing a mix there.  Some old-fashioned storytellers, some experimentalists, some people I've heard vaguely associated with left-wing politics, some people I've heard vaguely associated with right-wing politics, and many where I frankly have no idea.<br>
<br>
Honestly, the key to winning Hugos seems to be "Be Connie Willis".  (I have no idea what her politics are, but since one of the things she's famous for is biting satires of political correctness -- e.g. Uncharted Territory, Bellwether, Remake, Ado -- I'd be surprised if she were considered a culture warrior for political correctness.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017310" target="_self">4:11 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

<br>
I'm pretty sure <em>Firefly</em> shares neither my politics nor Joss Whedon's politics, really. There are little flashes from place to place, but in general, I think <em>Firefly</em> (and much more, <em>Serenity</em>) is straightforwardly anti-big-government, pro-rugged-individualism.<br>

And I love it. And sci-fi fandom loves it.<br>
<br>
Because I'm not the kind of guy, and it's not the kind of fandom, which requires all media to conform to our preexisting political biases.<br>

That's great!<blockquote><a href="http://blog.sadpuppies.org/2015/04/all-analogies-are-approrpriate.html">Remember your Orwell</a> -- merely silencing their opponents isn't enough for people like this; they have to force conformity. And what better way to do it than to capture us at Sasquan?  We could disappear into the rain forest of Washington -- a place hallowed by Scalzi and his acolytes -- and they could do whatever they want to us. Then, a year from now, Brad and Larry and, yes, even Vox would emerge and denounce their past "heresies". Soon they'd start publishing new books, but these books wouldn't be science fiction classics like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, "The Exchange Officers" and "Opera Vita Aeterna". No, these would be stories about transgendered bisexuals in a multiracial society fighting an evil, capitalistic empire through folk song. They'd be praised throughout the liberal blogosphere for their sensitive portrayals of "the Other" and would be handed Hugo nominations for their efforts. Vox Day would declare his love for N.K.

<br>
<em>"At a real witch trial held by the real Inquisition, even the devil gets an advocate and someone speaks up for defendant being accused of witchcraft."</em><br>
<br>
First of all, the Inquisition typically did not hold witch trials (as we think of them, they mostly occurred in Protestant countries, not Catholic ones, although a small handful occurred under Inquisitions; in fact, Inquisitions were sometimes tasked with stamping out witch trials as the belief in witchcraft was superstition.<br>
<br>
Second of all, "Devil's Advocates" come from the process of canonization of saints, not the Inquisition. The Devil's Advocate doesn't argue on behalf of the accused anywhere; they bring up evidence against the canonization of a saint in order to uncover character flaws that would prevent them becoming a saint.<br>
<br>
Third of all, the accused  in Inquisition trials were not entitled to counsel, a trivial fact familiar to most lawyers and most scholars of Catholicism, as it figures in the development of both modern curial courts and the modern American legal system.<br>
<br>
That's a big giant "F" for catechism class, Mr. Wright. Literally not one tiny piece of that statement is factually correct and it betrays a shocking ignorance of the history of law and the history of Catholicism, two areas in which I believe he considers himself quite expert.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017528" target="_self">7:07 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

		<a name="6017537"></a><div class="comments">Alright, I'm going to break these into five-year chunks, to save my sanity if nothing else. The first thing I will note is that a lot of these really defy precise left-right comparisons, particularly as the left and right of the 1990s are not the left and right of 2015. <br>
<br>
That said...<br>
<br>
<strong>1995</strong> - "None So Blind" by Joe Haldeman  - an interesting concept, but with an interracial romance that seems spackled onto the story. My first impulse is to say that in the 90s, this would mean that it was on the 'left' - though I will note that it has some major problems with sexism and consent, including fake operations on the wife's eyeballs without telling her but magically she loves him anyways.) Drecht.<br>
<br>
<strong>1996</strong>- "The Diamond Age" by Neal Stephenson - this one definitely skews extremely left in theme, but is truly marvellous science fiction. However, I'm also a biased observer because I really loved the shit out of this book, despite the class/corporate overtones.<br>
          "The Death of Captain Future" by Allan Steele  - deconstructus and subverts the pulp adventure genre in what seem kind of left wing ways - however, this is, like 1995, incredibly sexist as hell. I'm not really sure how to judge this other than as crap.<br>
<br>
There are two other really political stories this year - 'The Lincoln Train' and 'Babylon 5 - The Coming of Shadows' but for the life of me, I’m not sure whether they are left or right, and they’re both really good  regardless. Interestingly, however, the 1996 Hugo win for Babylon 5 is credited to campaigning online. <br>
<br>
<strong>1997</strong>- As duly called above, <em>Blue Mars</em> by Kim Stanley Robinson is being described by many as politics-heavy left stuff, but I haven't personally read it and can't say. Since I only have to choose one for each year, I have, however, read and chosen "Bicycle Repairman" by Bruce Sterling. This one isn't even really trying - an anarchist community draws ranks together against a 'right wing reactionary wacko' paramilitary force for a right-wing senator who's faking a country accent? I know this will get harder ahead, but for now, this year was easy. <br>
<br>
<small>Also - Whoa! Whoa! GRRM, you've been telling us all about how you never won a Hugo , and here is your name highlighted in red for 'Blood of the Dragon'. I call a foul, sir. </small><br>
<br>
<strong>1998:</strong> <em>Forever Peace</em> by Joe Haldeman – This one seems like another gimme. The protagonists, an interracial couple, seek to submit everyone to a surgical procedure that leaves them a docile pacifist in order to stop war. However, it is really important to note that I have not personally read this one, and I’m going off reviews. Feel free to hotly debate, or jeather I'm up for doing a readalong if you're thinking this.<br>
<br>
Best Novelette <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wMOhePVQ7ZIC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=we+will+drink+a+fish+together&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vhTcfew6rC&amp;sig=XoCr2p1AU5EhPRCTahMzLim6WpY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AcE2Vb29INPhoASal4C4AQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=we%20will%20drink%20a%20fish%20together&amp;f=false">“We Will Drink a Fish Together…” by Bill Johnson</a>  - oh man. This one isn’t demonstrably Right, but to be fair, I’d better flag it. It’s…rural-sympathetic, I guess, and about the importance of family hierarchies, but so damn good. Check it out. <br>
<br>
<strong>1999</strong>: This is one of the years where I and the Puppies might disagree, but I can see where they're coming from. I'd call  <a href="http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/OCEANIC/Complete/Oceanic.html">“Oceanic” by Greg Egan</a>  – the lefty pick of the year. You have some genderfucking, you have a deconstruction of religion that has its implications for real life. However, I found it a really good story, with all of that naturally interwoven into the text, and even if he came out deciding 'I'm going to write an atheist story' it is still a fabulous read.<br>
<br>
From the right, we potentially have <a href="http://lib.ru/STERLINGB/taklamakan.txt">"Taklamakan” by Bruce Sterling</a> (jeather or someone, keep me honest). It doesn't seem super right to me, and it contains 'neuter' gendered folk, but it also places military guys prominently and speaks of them favorably, but then also goes into the 'ethnic minority suppression' Really I don't count this for one side or the other, but I don't want someone to think I'm leaving it out. I found it a deadly dull read, personally.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017537" target="_self">7:20 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

What? No! The world is physically divided into conformist nations that provide  stability and security by invoking stereotyped depictions of former empires. The most powerful ones appear to be neo-Victorians and neo-Confucians, each of which is based around the idea of virtue through constancy and fidelity, and obedience to an anointed leader who is not merely right but <em>definitively</em> right. Our heroine is a Girl Who Makes Good through education and (substitute) maternal love, despite her bad circumstances; our hero is an engineer who wants <em>his</em> daughter to enter the ranks of the privileged, through education. His plan fails because his daughter just doesn't have the right stuff; she runs off to be a leftie art student and we never see her again. Our heroine literally becomes the empress of an army of indistinguishable Chinese children that were saved from infanticide - but you <em>know</em> that's a metaphor for abortion. Her substitute-mother is saved from the evil undersea hippies and I guess they found their own empire or whatever.<br>

		<a name="6017573"></a><div class="comments">Calling "Blue Mars" an automatic left story is really handwaving over the core tension of the story. Indeed, one of the biggest fights in the story is the "reds" vs. the "greens', but it's not what you think. The "Reds" believe in "Red Mars" -- do not terraform the planet, the Greens want to terraform Mars, and mapping these into conventional left-right models seems easy, until you realize that it's perfectly easy to make your main character map to the right wing extreme *and* the left wing extreme at the same time. <br>
<br>
There is a strong corporate/anti-corporate theme, which is also subverted as the trilogy goes on. <br>

In short, the only thing classifying the Mars Trilogy is good for is an argument.

I thought that Diamond Age was lefty because you have Nell, from the incredibly shitty underclass, getting a stolen copy of the Primer, thus subverting the intent of it going to the upperclass only, and it is she, rather than the upperclass recipients of the Primer like Elizabeth, who becomes the leader of the new phyle.

<br>
Finding a left-wing mini-Atlas-Shrugged "relevant to the current awards crisis" would have a point, I agree -- or rather, finding a whole bunch of them would be.  E.g. are there a whole bunch of not-well written left-wing polemics (but not right-wing ones) that have nonetheless won Hugos?  I'm pretty sure the answer is no.  I'll be interested to see corb's opinion when she gets through the list.<br>

One problem we're already seeing though is the question of what is left wing and what is right wing?  In books as in life, a lot of things don't slot neatly into one category or another.

<br>
There's no doom-warning.  The private corporations and separatist societies are explicitly successful and presented as not-unflawed but far better than the phyle-less cretins.  Atlantis/Shangai and... Ashanti?  Azanti?  the phyle of polite black badasses, anyway are good things and good ways to live.  The most you can suggest as being "lefty" is that what seems to be the most friendlily-described community are the group of independents who work with and for Atlantis, not Atlantis itself.<br>
<br>
Like almost all of Stephenson's work, Diamond Age is clearly and I think unavoidably conservative insofar as he almost always points out more-or-less traditional ways of living as good and sensible, or even superior to what people would commonly think of as "lefty" ways of living; pomo is bad and stupid and moral relativism is bad and stupid.  He even explains this in some of his infodumps.  In much the same way, the Mafia in Snow Crash are a traditionalistic and conservative way of living through intense economic and social dislocation that Stephenson presents as reasonably sensible and way better than the way that, say, Hiro has been living.  The only way you can get "lefty" out of him is that he doesn't extend this to describing conservative policies as intrinsically good and sensible the way he does a conservative ordering of ones' own life.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/15862" target="_self">ROU_Xenophobe</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017597" target="_self">8:27 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

<br>
This reminds me of <a href="http://revel.unice.fr/cycnos/?id=1462">this essay,</a> a comparison of Ayn Rand and Vladimir Nabokov, which traces Rand's style back to Chernyshevsky's <em>What Is To Be Done?</em>, a major inspiration to Lenin and others: <blockquote>Nabokov and Rand shared more than just the happenstance of time and place of birth. They shared a milieu in which Nikolai Chernyshevsky was a revered figure in the pantheon of the anti-establishment intelligentsia. Doubtless, neither found much to fancy in Chernyshevsky’s socialism. Yet in a sense, both writers-to-be responded to the Chernyshevsky tradition in ways that fundamentally shaped their future work. Rand took her utilitarian view of literature (and style) from Chernyshevsky — although substituting a very different ideological content. Chernyshevsky’s famous 1863 novel <em>What is to be Done? From Tales about the New People,</em> written in prison, became the progenitor of Socialist Realism and Rand’s Capitalist Realism — although in both cases the “realism” was anything but “real.” Rand, by the way, divided literature into “Naturalism,” an odious value-free approach that focussed on the seamy sides of man and society, and “Romanticism,” which exalted the feats of the principled rational individualist (Branden 24). Although her professed model was Victor Hugo (Branden 24-25), any connoisseur of Russian literature will recognize Chernyshevsky’s ascetic revolutionist Rakhmetov as a major prototype of her literary heroes and heroines. Rakhmetov was, of course, the foremost representative of “the new people” heralded in the subtitle of What is to be Done?<br>
<br>
Both Chernyshevsky’s opus and Rand’s <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> center upon a young woman who is or becomes an entrepreneur. She is one of the new people who will, after the collapse of the old society, build a better, rational world. Just as John Galt displays his ideal community to Dagny Taggart, Chernyshevsky’s heroine, Vera Pavlovna, offers her dream vision of a new perfect society. Each novel ends with the old world on the verge of being replaced by the new — although the message is obviously much muted in Chernyshevsky’s work. Both novels are cast as mystery melodramas full of didactic harangues. And, not least, both have been seen as monuments in the women’s rights movement.<br>
<br>
The Soviet Short Literary Encyclopedia sums up <em>What is to be Done?</em> as a “publicistic, socio-philosophical, educational novel,” something “almost unknown in earlier Russian literature.” The description fits Rand’s Atlas Shrugged like a glove, and if her opus is not the first American novel to do so, it is a fine example of that Russian genre transferred to American soil. Not surprisingly, Rand’s literary manifesto sounds quite at home in the context of Socialist Realism: “The motive and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man” (Romantic Manifesto 161).</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/148248" target="_self">Rustic Etruscan</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017603" target="_self">8:34 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

		<a name="6017613"></a><div class="comments">One thing I haven't seen yet on this very long thread is a serious discussion of the claim by Mr. Torgersen's defenders that he can't be a racist because he's married to an African-American and, I think, has children of mixed ancestry.  Here's the thing: this is so wrong in so many different ways that I find it difficult to write without spluttering.<br>
<br>
First is the notion that being in a relationship or marriage with someone constitutes a "Get Out of Jail Free" card when someone is called to account.  How many times have you heard a line like"I have a black friend.  We get along great.  I'm not a racist."  In the olden days, it used to be a Jewish friend, but it's the same fucking thing.  You can still have friends of color and still behave in a racist manner.<br>
<br>
Which gets to point number 2:  Even if you personally aren't a racist (whatever that term means), you can still behave in a racist manner.  It's actions that count here, not how you feel when you engage in those actions.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I'm surprised that no-one has yet mentioned Strom Thurmond, who for years was basically the walking personification of the word 'racist.'  Look him up on Wikipedia, and note that in 1948, his money quote was "I wanna tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that there's not enough troops in the army to force the Southern people to break down segregation and admit the Nigra race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes, and into our churches".  And after that he filibustered against one of the earlier Civil Rights Acts, wrote the first draft of the Southern Manifesto in opposition to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, and "...decried the Supreme Court opinion in <em>Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education</em> (1969), which ordered the immediate desegregation of schools in the American South." [per wikipedia]  Of course, this was  all decades after 1924, when as a 22 year old he'd impregnated a 16 year old African American maid in his parents' house, and then spent the remainder of his life paying for her education but never actually acknowledging her.  I'm not saying Brad Torgerson is the reincarnation of Strom Thurmond, but I am trying to point out how it's quite possible to be intimately involved with someone from another race as a parent or a lover, or merely a friend, and still behave in profoundly racist ways.<br>
<br>
Phillip Sandifer put it more clearly than I could "Observe the list of things that Torgersen does not want in his science fiction: racial prejudice and exploitation, sexism and the oppression of women, gay and transgender issues, the evils of capitalism and the despotism of the wealthy. "<br>
<br>

Interracial romance! I, corb, am shocked and disturbed!" I'm saying, "I think, in the 1990s, based on my own admittedly imperfect recollection of the 1990s, this would have been a somewhat liberal/left position."</i>"<br>
<br>
I feel like you know way worse Republicans than I do. My aunt, who is white, started dating a black man in 1965, in rural Michigan, and her white, conservative, Catholic, Republican parents welcomed him into their home even though doing so led to them being shunned by some friends and neighbors, including their pastor, and they were forced to drop out of some civic organizations.<br>
<br>
"Yay interracial relationships!" and standing up for them even in the face of social censure is a rural, religious, Republican position in NINETEEN SIXTY-FIVE.<br>
<br>
Seriously what do you imagine the average Republican <em>is</em> that they are anti-interracial-relationships in 1990? What you're presenting as right-wing beliefs -- that interracial relationships are progressive in 1990! -- is so insanely caricatured that I don't even know what the goal here is. I'm not really in the business of standing up for Republicans, but, Jesus Christ, why are you trying to make them look like racist assholes? My <em>mom</em>'s a Republican, corb. An interracial relationship in 1990 was not shocking to her and it was not outside her reading milieu because <em>she's not a moron</em> and she's not a bigot, she's just a Republican.<br>
<br>

<br>
It must be noted that the Libertarian Futurist Society's Prometheus Award has been won twice by Neal Stephenson, in 2005 for The System of the World and a Hall of Fame Award for Cryptonomicon in 2013. The mix of authors deemed "Libertarian" by these honors include both Ayn Rand (twice) and Ursula K. LeGuin, Robert Heinlein more often than anyone (6 Hall of Fame Awards), Cory Doctorow 3 times in the last 6 years, as well as Tolkein, Bester, Orwell (twice), Pratchett, MeFi's Own CStross (even the infamous JScalzi was nominated once for "Ghost Brigades") and Patrick McGoohan for the not-a-book original The Prisoner. A genuinely inconsistent mix of voices, in terms of politics, literary quality and fun-to-read-ness. Which does feel very "Libertarian".<br>
<br>
As for the James Triptee Jr. Literary Award (there's that word, Literary), I've been going through the awards on its rather awkward website and have not yet found any winner or short-lister that was also nominated for a Hugo. If they started showing up in recent years, it would provide support to the SOBs' claims about an "invasion of the literary", but sorry, it just ain't been happening.<br>
<br>
I appears to me more and more that the ultimate goal of Team Rabid is to have a Traditionalist, NeoFascist version of the Triptees but not to go to the trouble of creating one themselves. Besides, the Hugos are named after one of the oldest Old School editor/publishers and “Father of Magazine SF”. A throwback award that this particular clique just wants thrown back to them. (Not AT them.) If the survey MeFites are making proves anything (and I doubt it will prove much of anything), it's that a "fan award" decided on the vote of a few thousand among the multi-millions of fans of SF was already fatally flawed; we might as well throw it to the Hounds.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017640" target="_self">9:28 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

<br>
I've read it, and TBH I think that's kind of an uncharitable synopsis. They're not trying to force everyone to undergo sheeple surgery - there's a mind-linking technology already used for military purposes, and the protagonists discover that given enough time in this linked state one's empathy becomes strong enough that killing any other human becomes unthinkable.<br>

My community in the mid 90s included people who were not happy about interracial marriage. They were resigned to its inevitable acceptance, and they started having enough sense to not mouth off about it too loudly, but they'd make their feelings known.

<br>
Over at AV Club, Rowan Kaiser read <em><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/babylon-5/">Babylon 5</a></em>, the whole series, as a spirited defence of liberal democracy and of the power of institutions to solve intractable problems. Which would put it on the left. But Coming of Shadows as an individual episode does seem more about the ways that expanded power restricts one's options, which I don't find particularly political.<br>
<br>
<small>The liberal democracy thing was a recurring theme in Kaiser's reviews. I don't have the time right now to pick out the ones where he develops that line of thinking.</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017671" target="_self">10:05 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

<blockquote><em> c. while foregrounding a left message to the extent that the story was ruined or misshaped</em></blockquote>

seems to be handwaving away the fact that whether a story is "ruined or misshaped" is totally a matter of <em>opinion.</em> There's no mathematical equation any of us can point to where [X] number of interracial relationships times [Y] number of female protagonists divided by [Z] number of space gun fights = Lefty Ruination Factor of [R].<br>
<br>
And trying to argue or examine the controversy from that perspective is buying into the SP/RP narrative, getting suckered into playing the game on their terms, with their rules. Nobody needs to "prove" that they're wrong, because they can't "prove" that they're <em>right</em>, because this is all about their apparent inability to maturely deal with the concept that here in the 21st century a significant number of WorldCon members have <em><strong>different opinions</strong></em> about what constitutes "good" SF/F than they do.<br>
<br>
It is literally (yes, literally) childish, where "I don't like it" = "It is terrible." Actual adults can recognize that them personally not liking something is not necessarily a sign that that something is objectively terrible. <br>

<br>
JMS, who created B5 and wrote The Coming of Shadows is very much a liberal.  But, I don't think that comes across very strongly either in that particular episode or the series as a whole - if anything, I would boil the political message boils down to "blind adherence to ideology is bad" (hmmm.  HMMM, I say.) The episode itself really doesn't have a political message, I don't think - its strength is setting in motion some wheels that had been slowly built up and watching the immediate impact, as well as really being the starting point for certain key elements of the main story arc.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/179122" target="_self">nubs</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017680" target="_self">10:12 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

<br>
Yes, but corb's baseline assumption is that people who object to interracial marriage are right-wing and that stories that show interracial marriage are left-wing.<br>
<br>
I know there were still a lot of racist assholes wandering the mainstream in 1990, but I'm not sure it follows that those people were particularly left-wing or right-wing on an American spectrum. If, as corb suggests, opposition to interracial relationships is an inherently right-wing position, then, yes, I think she's going to find that the Hugos reflect a left-wing sensibility. The fundamental claim here is that the party of <em>Lincoln</em> (who died 150 years ago last week) is the party of racism and that racism is inherent and inalienable to the right wing -- a core tenet. Is that what you're claiming, corb?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017693" target="_self">10:26 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

Well, they were *predominately* right wing, even though you could find contrary examples on either side of it. (And I could.) <br>
<br>
Similarly, you can find very liberal people who think gay marriage is capitulation to heteronormative values, but *most* people that are against it aren't on that side of the spectrum.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/85311" target="_self">ChurchHatesTucker</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017702" target="_self">10:36 PM</a>  on April 21, 2015

Turns out there's data on this. <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-white-republicans-more-racist-than-white-democrats/">Are White Republicans More Racist Than White Democrats?</a> via Nate Silver and Alison McCann of FiveThiryEight. <blockquote>

<em> A longstanding question on the survey has asked whites whether they’d object to a close relative marrying a black person. The percentage of white people saying so has fallen drastically over time, to<strong> 20 percent of white Democrats and 27 percent of white Republicans as of 2012.</strong> In 1990, by contrast, 65 percent of white Democrats and 71 percent of white Republicans said they’d object to an interracial marriage of a close relative.</em></blockquote>

That sort of sentimentality always plays well with Hugo voters. The question of the interracial relationship is this—does it hurt the story? (It likely doesn't add very much, honestly.) But does the narrative warp itself to show that Interracial Relationships Are Good and Racists Are Bad? It doesn't even seem to come up.<br>

<br>
<em> Tolkien does, admittedly, rise above this sort of thing on occasions, in some key scenes, but often such a scene will be ruined by ghastly verse and it is remarkable how frequently he will draw back from the implications of the subject matter. Like Chesterton, and other orthodox Christian writers who substituted faith for artistic rigour he sees the petit bourgeoisie, the honest artisans and peasants, as the bulwark against Chaos. These people are always sentimentalized in such fiction because traditionally, they are always the last to complain about any deficiencies in the social status quo. They are a type familiar to anyone who ever watched an English film of the thirties and forties, particularly a war-film, where they represented solid good sense opposed to a perverted intellectualism. In many ways The Lord of the Rings is, if not exactly anti-romantic, an anti-romance. Tolkien, and his fellow "Inklings" (the dons who met in Lewis's Oxford rooms to read their work in progress to one another), had extraordinarily ambiguous attitudes towards Romance (and just about everything else), which is doubtless why his trilogy has so many confused moments when the tension flags completely. But he could, at his best, produce prose much better than that of his Oxford contemporaries who perhaps lacked his respect for middle-English poetry. He claimed that his work was primarily linguistic in its original conception, that there were no symbols or allegories to be found in it, but his beliefs permeate the book as thoroughly as they do the books of Charles Williams and C. S. Lewis, who, consciously or unconsciously, promoted their orthodox Toryism in everything they wrote. While there is an argument for the reactionary nature of the books, they are certainly deeply conservative and strongly anti-urban, which is what leads some to associate them with a kind of Wagnerish hitlerism. I don't think these books are 'fascist', but they certainly don't exactly argue with the 18th century enlightened Toryism with which the English comfort themselves so frequently in these upsetting times. They don't ask any questions of white men in grey clothing who somehow have a handle on what's best for us.</em><br>
<br>
Beale is noxious, but he just proves Moorcock and Spinrad and the rest of the New Wave right when talking about how reactionary sci-fi and fantasy can be.<br>

		<a name="6017908"></a><div class="comments"><i>it is just 100% ridiculous to me that it is somehow challenging immersion to use commonly accepted words for sexual orientations and yet it is totally unchallenged that a gagillion other sociological constructs, (heteronormativity, kissing, precious-metal based currency, romantic love, marriage, the English language, the nuclear family, gender roles, binary gender, the existance of modern sexual orientations at all, ritualized eating habits, 24 hour clocks, base-10, etc) pretty much stay unchallenged most of the time</i><br>
<br>
In come cases, that reluctance is down to deemphasizing LGBT people in a way that makes us almost invisible.<br>
<br>
But those "commonly accepted words" are both ethnocentric and heterosexist constructions. And that is killing people, not just in America, but cross-culturally as well. A fair bit of queer and feminist science fiction involves a radical deconstruction of heterosexism (along with all the other cultural constructions you mention). So I'm not willing to write off Jeminsin's <i>Kingdoms</i> or Sulway's <i>Rupetta</i> for re-imagining the cultural construction of sexuality by putting same-sex relationships at the center of the cultural myths. Or Delany for using different slang to describe bisexual plural marriage and how it's subculturally marginalized. Or Slonczewski, Lord, Le Guin, and Leckie for imagining cultures where heterosexuality isn't a primary method of social organization.<br>
<br>
That usually involves deconstructing family, gender, and sexual orientations as well.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6017908" target="_self">8:21 AM</a>  on April 22, 2015

		<a name="6018070"></a><div class="comments">It's frustrating to me when people treat the issue of authors of fiction representing the variety of human experience and identity as a political issue. At its root it's an aesthetic concern, which has little to do with politics. Many above have spoken eloquently about the importance of representation, so I'm going to set that aside and focus on how the narrative possibilities multiply when an author is inclusive.<br>
<br>
Inclusivity fundamentally changes the kinds of stories we tell. Though it isn't really true that there are only a limited number of plots, there are some narrative structures authors employ over and over again. I'd like to take an example of one of those recurring plots to show how being open to the variety of human experience and identity opens up an array of new narrative possibilities.<br>
<br>
The love triangle has been a recurring narrative structure for many centuries, featuring in millions of different fictional works. Almost all love triangles take two forms:  <blockquote>1) One person is in love with two people and can't choose between them.<br>
<br>
2) Two people are in love with one person and compete for their love's affection. </blockquote>To represent this in a crude chart, the two forms of love triangle look like this: <blockquote><pre>1)

       Dana </pre></blockquote>I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with those two types, many of my favorite works of fiction make use of them. However, these are not the only possibilities when you include more than just heteronormative pairings in a story. These two forms presuppose that humans are only attracted to one gender, that men are only attracted to women and vice versa. If we acknowledge the fact that many humans do not fit that pattern, we get different kinds of love triangles. Here are four that come immediately to mind: <blockquote>3) Three people who are all in love with each other.<br>
<br>
4) Person A loves person B and not C. B loves C and not A. And C loves A and not B.<br>
<br>
5) Person A loves people B and C. B loves C and not A. But C loves A and not B. <br>
<br>
6) Person A loves people B and C. B loves C and A. But C loves A and not B. </blockquote>And in chart form: <blockquote><pre>3)

Unlike the other two, they haven't been written about continuously for centuries, but are relatively unexplored. Furthermore, they're actual triangles, creating a dynamic between all three people in the love triangle. In the traditional ones, two people are inert to each other, i.e. there can be no attraction between them, in either direction.<br>
<br>
Being inclusive is not just a political choice, but fundamentally an aesthetic one because it brings with it the possibility of telling many different kinds of stories. And the love triangle is just one example of the narrative possibilities inherent in inclusivity. Saying it's just political is wrong.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018070" target="_self">11:25 AM</a>  on April 22, 2015

Though it's hard to say with some of them -- Is 'The Water Which Falls Down On You From Nowhere' political simply because it's about a gay couple? In a way the entire plot is about that -- is that warped by it, or is it simply the plot? (This is essentially the question of can a protagonist be a Mary Sue in their own novel.)

And I think no, <strong>Artw</strong> we can't go with our own image of 'normal people' on this - I think we have to, really fairly, consider whether people could consider something left or right wing. (I note my own cite of where something could be considered right even though it wouldn't jump out at me as it.) And much as we might say 'well obviously people who don't like gay marriage are bigots' for example, a bare seven years ago, none of the candidates for the Democratic Primary were willing to endorse it. It's really important to consider not what we believe, but what the broad 'People' believe when measuring where something falls politically.<br>
<br>
I would especially appreciate eyes like jeather and others' noting if they think something which won is conservative or from the right - it might be something that I might not notice, but someone more left wing than myself might. As it stands, through the five year period I already looked at, I don't see a lot of conservative SF, but other people may disagree (and we do have one Cadillac-driving Jesus vote for Diamond Age, frex)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018168" target="_self">12:01 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

<br>
Yeah, that's the thing, which is hard to pin down.<br>
<br>
Case in point: Tobias Buckell's <i>Arctic Rising</i>, which is a near-future thriller in a world where climate change has resulted in somewhat unregulated development in the Arctic. The lead character is a lesbian Nigerian helicopter pilot working for the UN, and the baddies are, IIRC, engineering geniuses who think they can engineer their way out of an environmental apocalypse.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed the book, but found it flawed because it periodically stops the story to shoe-horn in a discussion of the backstory.  The politics of the book are obvious: it's got a diverse cast, and a plot that deals directly with ongoing environmental issues we face right now.  But the <i>problems</i> of the book are not associated with its politics: the problems are structural.<br>
<br>
I think it's too easy to claim that X book is political, and it's not a good book, and <i>therefore</i> the politics are the problem.  Which isn't necessarily true, or fair.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018249" target="_self">12:28 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

And also whether or not that viewpoint wrecks the story. A good story isn't one that doesn't have politics at all, is my understanding, but the politics of it shouldn't be the reason for the story (I think that's what I mean). That's going to be quite subjective; if one's politics are such that <em>any</em> appearance of positive portrayals of gay people (e.g. JCW's rant about the hand-holding at the end of Korra) ruins the story, well....<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/43189" target="_self">rtha</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018276" target="_self">12:39 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

<br>
But in 1995, a basic acceptance and tolerance of homosexuality was in no way a given with the broader general public - even if, which I'm not sure it was, it was totally cool in SF. I mean, in 1998, Matthew Shepherd was beaten to death and even though a lot of us were outraged and marching in the streets, I very clearly remember the reactions of others who didn't understand what all the fuss was - and it would take an additional<em> 11 years</em> for legislation to be passed.<br>
<br>
But again, I think that this all gets to the core of why this is such a contentious issue. What <em>counts</em> as left-wing or right wing  politicization of stories? Is it every appearance of X where X is not strictly necessary for the story to take place? (A gay character where the character does not need to be gay for the story to move, for example) Or is it only appearances of X when X seem violently shoehorned in or take over the story with talking about X? Or only appearances of X when appearances of X in the story outweigh the representative examples of X in real life?<br>
<br>
Anyway, though - does anyone mind if we start our story reading from the early years and work up? I ask this purely selfishly since I already started in chronological order. :)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018399" target="_self">1:29 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

No. I refuse to accept that every character who isn't a straight white Christianish guy is political by definition. Is there a REASON for [x] to be a guy? <br>

Ok, seriously?  That suggestion, that you can only have a gay character if there's some plot reason for the character to be gay, is itself political.  The idea that straight white men are default people, and everyone else needs to have their existence justified?  That's political.

I think what I'm trying to say is that there existed a period - which may actually continue to this day for some integers, I'm not even sure - where both prejudice existed against values of X and that people were bothered by prejudice existing against values of X, such that they would deliberately put them into stories as a way to say 'Stop being prejudiced against values of X, you assholes.'

		<a name="6018442"></a><div class="comments">I think(?) people are missing a little what corb is trying to do here ... I get the impression she's approaching the project in stages.<br>
<br>
Stage 1: What Hugo-winning works can be reasonably identified as having either progressive or conservative political themes?<br>
<br>
Stage 2: Once these works have been identified, are there any that can be said to have sacrificed writing quality for the sake of Message?<br>
<br>
I think it's been acknowledged that both of these questions are tricky and highly subjective, and can be argued about extensively for many individual works.  And getting an answer to them for any individual work is still meaningless in terms of the Hugos.  But it is still possible to use these questions as rough guides to detect larger patterns.<br>
<br>
What I mean:<br>
<br>
Many people (not all) believe that Blue Mars could reasonably be said to contain progressive political elements.  Many reviews of the work (not all) seem to feel that Blue Mars was kind of a slog to read through.<br>
<br>
This, in and of itself, doesn't mean anything.  A lot of people don't think it's the politics that made the book a slog to read.  I tend to think that Green Mars and Blue Mars won as consolation prizes because the much more popular and interesting Red Mars didn't, which has nothing to do with left/right politics.<br>
<br>
But if we start seeing that it as a pattern, it might be more meaningful.  If year after year after year, there's stuff where it could reasonably be said, "many people believe X is progressive, many reviews say X is pretty meh", that can be taken as evidence that there is a tendency to reward progressive politics over storytelling.<br>
<br>
Do I think we're going to see that?  No, I think it's a ridiculous contention.  But there's no harm in looking and discussing.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018442" target="_self">1:50 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

<br>
Yeah, it is, and brings up a hidden problem.  It means inclusivity FOR WHATEVER REASON gets counted as being a progressive message, and exclusivity FOR WHATEVER REASON does NOT get counted as being a conservative message.<br>
<br>
For example, say there's an interracial couple in a story.  Say that's a bit unusual for the time.  You notice it.  You wonder, OK, why is that there?  Was it just how the characters seemed to be to the author, is there a message about tolerance there, are they just trying to project likely social changes into the future, what's up?  Maybe it's a message about politics.  Mark it tentatively as a progressive work.<br>
<br>
Now, say there's a story which DOESN'T have an interracial couple.  Do you even notice?<br>
<br>
But do you know what the author intended there?  Is it just how the characters came to the author, or are they someone who thought at the time, "interracial couples, ugh, can't have that?"  How would you know?  Just as with the first, you can't ... but this time, you didn't even ask.  And suddenly the higher number of "progressive" stories as compared to "conservative" stories you're finding starts to look questionable.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018461" target="_self">1:59 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

That is why I need yoooooooooooooooooooooooou. :) But in seriousness, I do know what you mean. For example - I just finished ‘Scherzo with Tyrannosaur’ (Winner: 2000 short story) and it screamed to me ‘Yes! I am a Hugo winner! I deserve to be a Hugo winner! Jesus fuck, that is everything I love about science fiction! Fuck yeah!’ But I am also capable of noting and can’t even help myself from noting that the women do receive rather short shrift in the story, condensed down to beautiful, vapid placeholders who have sex clutching dinosaur horns. And why is that? Is it because the author can't write women or doesn't consider them important? Is it because in the 90s that was considered just normal? Is it because the author was a super reactionary asshole who wanted to show women their place? I can't know. I want to know! I do! But I can't. That's one thing that makes this so damn hard. (Not to mention that even lefties were sexist sadly but that is a whole other story).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018486" target="_self">2:14 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

Brown leaned back in her leather-covered chair of high office and smiled wisely. "As you know, Bob, ever since our Ultimate Court rulings during the Post-Millenial Regency, there has been increasing acceptance among the Am'rican people of relationships -- even marriages! -- between men and men or between women. Why, many provinces, including my own native O'r'gun, even now allow marriages between partners of the third sex! These 'third sex marriages' have been legal for only a short time, but our 'household partnership' laws have made things legal for over ten years." She laughed. "People thought it would cause problems, but it has been less of an issue than the failure of our O'r'gun Smeerps sportsball team."</blockquote>Fanciful fiction?

Because if you're going to do the first, then I think you also have to do the second, although to be honest I think both are a little weird.</em><br>
<br>
I don't think that's true.  I think it's a perfect example of the concept of normalization and also the oft-attacked liberal whose conscious liberalness in some areas allows them to more confidently miss the fact that they are unconsciously reactionary in other areas.<br>
<br>
Part of something being "normal" is that you can and often do communicate regarding it without at all considering what you are doing: it's default, it's passive.  To step outside a norm requires effort, conscious thought: it's active.  So a story that follows cultural norms may be conservative, or may be liberal: the mere absence of items challenging the norm within a single story isn't enough to reveal anything.  But an active challenge gives a definite indicator.  You'll never find a casual (unthinking, not used to make a point) interracial marriage in a bigot's work, for example.<br>
<br>
As has been discussed, this becomes delicate as you approach the threshold of a paradigm shift, such as in the mid-90s, where interracial marriage acceptance at last pushes into the majority and becomes a norm itself.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/94123" target="_self">Palindromedary</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6018545" target="_self">2:37 PM</a>  on April 22, 2015

I thought Stop Being Assholes was a big and explicit subplot of at least one of her novels, which I remember as more of a coming out story with magic. But as I've said above, I don't see anything wrong with political science fiction whether we're talking Vonnegut, Heinlein, Tepper, or even Correa where firearms have more character than people.

The thing is, it's a great story without that! It doesn't need it!<br>
<br>
<strong>2001</strong>: I am forced to consider <a href="http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/different-kinds-of-darkness/">'Different Kinds of Darkness'</a> as a more-right-than-left story - it does contain children who expose the protection of adults as unnecessary, but it also involves eco terrorists willing to kill millions of people and children for their goals. <br>
<br>
Now, as a true Harry Potter fan, what I totally want to do is deconstruct every angle of the politics of JK Rowling's "The Goblet of Fire" and spend pages and pages of happy geekery, but I will concede that though it contains multitudes of politics within it, some of which have been debated on this site, some of it by me, it is no way a 'Left' or 'Right' novel but a massively popular one.<br>
<br>
"The Ultimate Earth" by Jack Williamson would have to be my left-pick here, but I have to admit it's pretty thin - it does posit this future society where all aggression has been removed and everyone is a pacifist through the use of nanobots, but that's also a pretty standard science fiction trope and there's not a lot of banging-over-the-head except from a conservation angle, which is again, a common trope.<br>

		<a name="6019352"></a><div class="comments">I think environmental SF (like Wall-E and the aforementioned Ecotopia) is probably the easiest place to point to situations where explicitly political messages are obvious and drive the plot or worldbuilding. Thing is, though, as <i>consistent with what had been well-understood science for decades at that point</i> implies, it's pretty hard to find straight-up climate change denialism in science fiction because…you know, science. The only real example I can find of a conservative/anti-environmentalist counterpart is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_Angels_%28science_fiction_novel%29">Fallen Angels</a>, which doesn't deny climate change, but whose dystopia is the result of environmentalists who took over the government and made the environment worse by trying to fix global warming and then also set up re-education camps because government is bad and environmentalists are bad so an environmentalist government has to be like <em>quadruple</em> bad.<br>
<br>
More broadly, I think you could put construct a scale with "used-up earth" at one end and "space mining/expansion and exploitation of interplanetary resources" (a sort of galactic extension of "dominion over the earth") at the other, but you could find examples of either trope in works with a diverse showing of economic/social/political reasoning.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/117509" target="_self">kagredon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6019352" target="_self">2:49 AM</a>  on April 23, 2015

		<a name="6019371"></a><div class="comments"><em>An example of a story where left politics do ruin the story: THE WORD FOR WORLD IS FOREST by Ursula K. Le Guin as the baddies exist basically only to be bad. They have no motivation other than to be hissed at by the presumptive liberal reader. It's also an allegory about the Vietnam War that doesn't illuminate that conflict, or conflicts like it, in any way. Basically, it reads like a book for tiny children who need moral instruction—war is bad.</em><br>
<br>
I didn't think TWFWIF was at all subtle, so I understand having a reaction to it along these lines. However, I think its lack of subtlety should be read quite differently from this. For one thing, the baddies that I recall are colonialists, much more comparable to the baddies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_War">Black War</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Desert">Conquest of the Desert</a> than to Vietnam's baddies. That isn't to say US involvement in Vietnam wasn't an allegorical target too--I understand that it was--but the supposedly unmotivated baddies in the story just aren't the same as Vietnam's baddies and instead share the motivations of genocidal, territory-grabbing colonialists from other periods in history. It's not a subtle representation, and you could reasonably wonder why 19th C. attitudes are governing the establishment of colonies in space, but the problem isn't that it's not based on kinds of motives real people have actually had. As to how the story illuminates that kind of conflict, it puts the focus on an indigenous resistance movement more comparable to the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/147930/The-Pueblo-people-orchestrated-the-unthinkable">Pueblo Revolt</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdist_War">Mahdi Uprising</a> than to Vietnam in that there's a charismatic leader involved in stirring folks up, and several of his key characteristics have to do with things like having embedded local knowledge and being connected to divinity / local wisdom. Again, not subtle, but not wrong. <br>
<br>
So I think what's crucial to recognize in reducing all the unsubtle stuff the story has in it to an allegory about Vietnam is that the reading is <em>only allegorical</em>, because, sure, the conflict in Vietnam was different. These other conflicts--generally well-known to anthropologists and presumably to Le Guin, daughter of one of the most famous anthropologists of the 20th C.--took place on a smaller scale well in the past, and the people involved generally had more obvious motives. But it's not wrong to see in them parallels to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Ph%C3%B9ng">charismatic anticolonialist leaders</a> from earlier episodes in Vietnamese history or to US policy-makers in the Vietnam War operating without a sensitive grasp of local points of view--which I recall being a problem explored in the story. I mean, the US Army at the time was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Camelot">well-aware of its need for an anthropological understanding of insurgent groups</a> (it was <a href="http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/3932.htm">kind of a big deal</a> in anthropology at the time Le Guin was writing), but I don't know that they achieved the sympathetic and <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/committees/ethics/ch2.htm">ethical</a> kind of understanding that Le Guin tried to illustrate. <br>
<br>
Incidentally, I also think it's very unfair to the story to say that its moral is simply that war is bad. My recollection is that it spends a substantial chunk of the narrative exploring how locals interact with each other, what the meanings of their behaviors are, and how they're constrained by a different set of norms, such that you have to look at things from their point of view to understand what they do. Le Guin borrows cultural stuff from Australian groups, but also from Native American groups, languages with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_gender#Gender-specific_vocabulary">gender-specific vocabularies</a>, etc., etc. I remember it being one of the most straightforward examples of anthropological SF there is, and her point that maybe the locals were organized in a way that was ecologically important and meaningful continued to be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691130663/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="0691130663">current anthropology</a> for at least a decade after she wrote the story. Anyway, I'm pretty sure that, in addition to the anticolonialist message perhaps aimed at children or the environmentalist message perhaps aimed at graduate students, you're supposed to get what was in the 70's still an undergraduate-level lesson in avoiding ethnocentrism and looking at the world from other points of view. Not subtle and not without its flaws, but especially for its time, a moral that's not just for tiny children and also not lacking a basis in empirical social science.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/93769" target="_self">Monsieur Caution</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6019371" target="_self">3:37 AM</a>  on April 23, 2015

<br>
The irony is, that was an argument against the Pious Critic. The politically correct ones who had either panned or refused to read <em>Starship Troopers</em> because of its  libertarian, pro-military, quasi-fascistic philosophies. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MQPHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=heinlein+%22Surely+any+writer+has+the+right+to+choose+an+unpopular+theme,+and+develop+it+with+all+his+skill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N_Y4VYvGAYfEogSJ9IGYDw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=heinlein%20%22Surely%20any%20writer%20has%20the%20right%20to%20choose%20an%20unpopular%20theme%2C%20and%20develop%20it%20with%20all%20his%20skill%22&amp;f=false">Google Books has the full quote,</a> and it's worth reading for the context.  <br>
<br>
Heinlein is also quoted there for one of his more well-known statements regarding <em>Starship Troopers</em>' reception by the critics: "Surely any writer has the right to choose an unpopular theme, and develop it with all his skill, without being condemned -- without being identified with the thing he writes!" <br>
<br>
Which is of course a similar yet somewhat opposite complaint to that of the Puppies, who believe they are being shunned for holding unpopular opinions in real life, not necessarily for writing them into their work, or for writing poorly.   Similar in that the argument being made is that the art is not the artist. Opposite for obvious reasons.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18312" target="_self">zarq</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6019522" target="_self">9:47 AM</a>  on April 23, 2015

The pious critic Heinlein describes is a techno-optimist, a "quasi-socialist" by which he means a Star Trek socialist who imagines conflicts must dissolve when we get to the future world of plenitude, and a boring liberal progressive who imagines that we're all one invention away from a just society. I think that's as much as description of the puppies as the Just-For-Fun critic: happy if we get freedom and equality without sacrifice or struggle or maybe having the confront our own complicity.<br>
<br>
Strangely, I think Heinlein largely does fit on that Procrustean bed he's decried. Sure I guess there's some slightly transgressive sex stuff in the later work (or wait.. isn't there incest in one of the last books?) The Foundation series is about the problem with technocratic utopias, I guess, but not in a very relevant way compared to the ways that more contemporary work on dystopias tackle those issues.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36760" target="_self">anotherpanacea</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6019550" target="_self">10:12 AM</a>  on April 23, 2015

<br>
By today's standards he's reactionary. But at the time certain books were published, they and he were considered controversially progressive. <br>
<br>
<em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> (1961) in particular was deeply transgressive: it touted free love, polyamory and pushed the idea that sex was positive because it was pleasurable -- as opposed to the more traditional Catholic/Christian religious shaming of the act. <em>Time Enough for Love</em> (1973) featured Lazarus Long having an incestuous relationship with his mother. The two books fall into his "Middle Period" not his last works. <br>
<br>
<em>The Foundation series is about the problem with technocratic utopias, I guess, but not in a very relevant way compared to the ways that more contemporary work on dystopias tackle those issues.</em><br>
<br>
I assume you mean the <em>Future History</em> series? Asimov did the <em>Foundation</em> series. Although Heinlein's novels and short stories often revolved around specific technologies, I don't know if I'd call the worlds of that series technocratic utopias.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/18312" target="_self">zarq</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6019595" target="_self">10:49 AM</a>  on April 23, 2015

It's not the whole thrust of the novel, but (also Niven and Pournelle's) Footfall has, IIRC, one character who's an environmentalist but otherwise smart who Comes To His Senses and gives himself a mental speech about how we should have been worrying about whether we have enough nuclear-powered orbital laser fortresses to fend off interstellar invaders and not about the environment because the invaders will just fuck it up anyway.<br>

<em>The title of this post was inspired by a podcast that Kevin guested on. One of the hosts of the show was complaining that, no matter what fandom did in response to Puppygate, VD was bound to win. I thought that was wrong, so I started thinking about who the winners and losers were in all of this.<br>
<br>
The most obvious losers are, of course, Correia and Torgersen. Firstly they have been portrayed in large numbers of articles all over the mainstream media as a couple of bad losers who, when they didn’t get the share of the Hugo cake they felt they were entitled to, invited a bunch of thugs (VD and GamerGate) to come and piss all over the cake so that no one could have it. Secondly, as has been pointed out by many people, they have been totally pwned by VD. And they daren’t try to dissociate themselves from him too strongly because if they do he’ll come after them next.</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/25884" target="_self">Artw</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6019660" target="_self">12:01 PM</a>  on April 23, 2015

That said, they had none, so I'm probably going to Kindle a few, at least the ones that it looks like nitty gritty reads are required for.

Wright made a habit of creating fiction in which gods or godlike beings played a huge part. As an atheist, however, they were fake gods, or techno gods, or gods without the problem of religion, and of course he never expected anyone to take him seriously.<br>
<br>
Now, post-conversion, he may no longer feel like he can in good conscience make up these gods, and figures 'hey, I"ll work with gods that I think are real!' not understanding that part of what makes fake gods interesting is that you are building an entire ethos, not just repeating one currently in circulation.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6020096" target="_self">4:29 PM</a>  on April 23, 2015

<blockquote>Baen Books Announces... A new novel by Hugo finalist, Audie Award Winner, and New York Times best-selling author, Larry Correia, titled <em>Wendell</em></blockquote>

It is speculated that the title character is <a href="http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/04/15/wendells-roughnecks-shirts/">a manatee</a>. Now I am SO glad I don't go by 'Wendell' anymore, even though just a few days ago, I learned that Ursula "Digger" Vernon (an author I DO respect) has been publishing a series of children's books about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0147513219/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="0147513219">Danny Dragonbreath</a>, who has a best-friend/sidekick named Wendell and I had begun pondering my own Wendell revival (subject to reading the antics of Wendell in the books, of course).<br>
<br>
<strong>Anyway, as a Former Wendell, I wish to formally disavow any possible connection with Corriea's Wendell book, and that my favorite aquatic mammal is NOT the Manatee, but rather the Otter.</strong><br>

Oh god. <blockquote>Nonetheless, I think it is significant that neither the books’ covers, nor any of the back-of-the-book summaries — the stuff, in short, that usually gets the browsing reader to pick up a paperback and buy it — mentions what is usually considered the most “important” aspect of Vanyel’s life story: the fact that he is gay. And it is not until the reader is at least 40% into the first book, and hopefully already well-engaged by the story, that this revelation is made not only about the character but to the character; in other words, the story is structured to draw readers in and then surprise them with that element, in such a way that I cannot help but think (though this is admittedly unproveable) it was deliberately designed to reach audiences who would not have bought the book if they had known about the hero’s sexuality right up front.</blockquote>

<br>
I haven't read Ancillary Justice yet, but "The Water That Falls On You From Nowhere' is gorgeous. But the thing about it - even laying aside the gay angle that may be what's being objected to, if you make them just racially diverse or what have you - it is the human connections that make that story fly. That story is a romance about people  with some sci fi elements, not a sci fi story with some romance elements. <br>
<br>
However, that's also been a part of SF/Fantasy since the beginning. I refuse to embark on another reading project when I haven't finished my first one, but I'd bet there are a lot of others that meet that mold, but it's not obvious to them because it doesn't involve gay characters or a coming out.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6020264" target="_self">6:52 PM</a>  on April 23, 2015

The meat of the conflict centers on two different directions of transhumanism and the resulting effects on culture, politics, military policy, and moral accountability. That, and having a richly detailed setting is probably why it won six awards last year.<br>
<br>
It's also, counter to stereotype, almost anti-romantic. <br>
<br>
I find it interesting that no one is throwing The Player of Games against the wall for arbitrarily assigning gendered pronouns to Culture characters for the convenience of its barbarian readers who are even more savage than the antagonists that the Culture is trying to assimilate. The narrator breaks the fourth wall to tell us this in the introduction to Act 2.

		<a name="6020543"></a><div class="comments">So in my quest to better understand what -if any- specific works or acts Brad Torgersen considers to be bad in the Hugos, Ive been digging through his blog. This has been a silly use of time, since its clear that the Sad Puppies are really just cover for Vox Days slate. Nonetheless, I wanted some evidence that I could grasp. Here are my observations. I tried to find good quotes, but some are really more from the gestalt.
<ul>
<li>Torgersen believe that <em>Chicks Dig Time Lords</em> won because of a whisper campaign
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/former-tor-editor-still-longs-to-gatekeep-the-field/">"<em>Chicks Dig Time Lords</em> beat <em>The Resnick &amp; Malzberg Dialogues</em> for Best Related Work [b]ecause TruFans are so obviously devoted to scholarly, serious discussion and inspection of the field."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/former-tor-editor-still-longs-to-gatekeep-the-field/">There are also “flash crowd” campaigns, such as the one which saw <em>Chicks Dig Time Lords</em> make, and then win, its respective category for its year. There were certainly more sage and scholarly related works competing with Chicks Dig Time Lords, but as one veteran said to me before the final vote, “You’ve got probably thirty women writing and editing in that book, and all of them have lots of friends. Of course it’s going to win.”</a></li>
</ul>

</li><br>
<li>Unhappiness that <em>The Wheel Of Time</em> was nominated for a Hugo is a sign of problematic old guard outrage against the popular.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/why-sad-puppies-3-is-going-to-destroy-science-fiction/">Witness the literal booing and groans (last year) when it was announced that Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time was nominated.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-3/"><em>Wheel of Time</em> fans managed to get the entire series (Jordan/Sanderson) on the ballot too — for Best Novel Hugo. Which is not precisely against the rules of the nomination process, but <em>Wheel of Time</em> is a massive series that is almost 30 years old. Seeing it in the Best Novel category alongside the other books for 2014 is highly unusual to say the least. So unusual, in fact, that some people in fandom have chosen to get upset about it</a></li>
</ul>

</li><br>
<li>The fact that media tie-in books &amp; popular books dont get Hugo noms is a sign of fandom/literary stuffiness.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/big-fat-old-guys-with-beards/">Consider Star Trek books. By many standards, the long-running and ever-unfolding series of Star Trek novels are the best-selling and most widely published set of single-subject novels in the entire world... But who among the SF Old Guard will ‘own’ these books, as part of the so-called community? You practically never see a media book win a Hugo or a Nebula, even though such books have been written by Nebula or Hugo level writers. Even though the source material for these books can and often does win awards — in the categories of film and television.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-3/">“But, Monster Hunter Nation and Wheel of Time fans are not our kind of fans!”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/mormons-cant-write-real-literature/">"The deciders of Great Literature do not easily abide anything which achieves widespread public recognition outside accepted literary or critical channels."</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_in_the_Snow">"Cipher in the Snow"</a> was overrated. (same post as above)</li>
</ul>

</li><br>
<li>Joy at diverse awards bodies because they happen to be diverse is a sign of affirmative action-esque tendencies.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-5-sad-puppies-2-post-mortem/">I noted with unhappiness the “squee” that erupted from some individuals when an all-female Nebula list hit the internet airwaves earlier in the season.</a></li>
</ul>

</li><br>
<li>Baen authors and <em>Analog</em> authors dont win Hugos much these days.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/hugo-losers-speech/">"As happened in 2012, I felt like something of an outsider to the final ballot, only more so this time because I’ve added “Baen author” to my list of credentials, along with a second <em>Analog</em> magazine AnLab readers’ choice award. Men with my kind of pedigree just don’t get to have Hugo awards very often these days. Maybe in 1970, when Larry Niven won for <em>Ringworld</em>. But not now. The Worldcon cotillion’s zeitgeist just isn’t there, for a guy like me to easily score a rocketship."</a></li>
</ul>

</li><br>
<li>Theres a real concern that worldcon is small and shrinking, and that it needs to expand to soak up more of the folks who show up at ComicCons. <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/world-science-fiction-convention-and-salt-lake-city-comic-con/">This Worldcon v. ComicCon post.</a><br>
</li><br>
</ul>

Also, as a final note, Torgersen mentions that Vox Day <em>also</em> ran a slate during Sad Puppies 2. Has anyone crunched the numbers for how well it did at the time?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6020543" target="_self">10:02 PM</a>  on April 23, 2015

		<a name="6020855"></a><div class="comments">Some of their contentions, I honestly struggle to figure out what they're talking about.<br>
<br>
For example, on prominent Puppy blog posts and comments I've many times seen the contention that there is some kind of prejudice in the Hugos against authors published by Analog.<br>
<br>
Looking at the years before the Puppies started getting works on in 2013, the last time a work from Analog got nominated for one of the Big Four Writing Awards was ... 2012.  It was by Brad Torgersen.  Before that, though, you have to look all the way back to ... 2011 (Eric James Stone AND Sean McMullen).  What are they talking about?  In 2003, long after the mid-90's when Torgersen says everything started going south, Analog stories WON THREE OUT OF THOSE FOUR AWARDS CATEGORIES.<br>
<br>
Another contention is that the Hugos are prejudiced against Baen authors.  As I've noted before Baen, which as far as I know mainly publishes novels, has been nominated and won in that category EXACTLY the median number of times for a Hugo-winning publishing company (8 nominations and 2 wins for best novel).  And of course they're doing better than any of the many which have never won anything -- Avon has 5 nominations and no wins, Pyramid has 4 nominations and no wins, etc., etc., etc., and dozens if not more have never gotten a nomination at all.<br>
<br>
(And during the very brief period when Jim Baen had a sci-fi magazine that published shorter works -- Jim Baen's Universe, which only ran from 2006-2010 -- stories from there got a few nominations.)<br>
<br>
I read Puppy nominee Michael Williamson say that Gene Wolfe and Steven Barnes are the kind of authors the Puppies are trying to champion, because the Hugos are prejudiced against them.  Barnes has been nominated.  Gene Wolfe has been nominated NINE TIMES.  No, they never won.  But being nominated puts them ahead of Michael Moorcock, Tim Powers, and J.G. Ballard.  Not winning puts them in the company of Lester del Rey and Ray freakin' Bradbury.<br>
<br>
The things they said are winning unfairly are equally baffling to me.  Ancillary Justice?  So the affirmative action cabal not only controls the popular-vote Hugos, but also the Clarke, the Nebulas, The BSFA, Locus, and the Kitschies?  And all the book reviews?  And the readers who have bought more copies of it than, say, Correia's latest book?<br>
<br>
I get that they don't like these works, but how can they possibly believe that everyone else secretly feels the same way and they're only being promoted by a small social-issues oriented cabal?  Redshirts sold something like 80,000 copies BEFORE it came out in paperback.  Who do they think was buying it?  Do they think the ~400 people who ranked it number 1 on the 2013 Hugo ballot each duped 200 close friends into picking up a hardcover copy?<br>
<br>
What are they TALKING about?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6020855" target="_self">5:21 AM</a>  on April 24, 2015

		<a name="6021047"></a><div class="comments">One of the things I find interesting about novels offered by women over the last few years is that they tend to reject the romance plot line of meeting, misunderstanding, and resolution.<br>
<br>
It's reasonable to interpret Breq in Ancillary Justice as aromantic if not asexual, although Sword briefly describes masturbatory sex among ancillaries. Seivarden's ambiguous interest in Breq has been largely unappreciated.<br>
<br>
Lord's Best of All Possible Worlds has a romantic relationship without a romantic misunderstanding. Grace even has a business-trip fling with a third party, which results in absolutely no jealousy on the part of the man she marries in the last chapter. This is in refreshing contrast to, "You had sex with him? I must reevaluate my life and our relationship."<br>
<br>
Goblin Emperor gives us an arranged marriage by government decree, so the question there isn't "will they?" but "what kind of relationship will they have?"<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021047" target="_self">9:26 AM</a>  on April 24, 2015

		<a name="6021066"></a><div class="comments"><em>The things they said are winning unfairly are equally baffling to me. Ancillary Justice? So the affirmative action cabal not only controls the popular-vote Hugos, but also the Clarke, the Nebulas, The BSFA, Locus, and the Kitschies? And all the book reviews?</em><br>
<br>
What I take away from this is  the magnitude of their dislike of these kind of works. The <em>size</em> of their pain that the culture is in a different spot from them. I think Torgerson's counter would be that, yeah, <em>Ancillary Justice</em> is well-reviewed, but is it <strong>popular</strong>?<br>
<br>
But really, I'd say that the thing to double-down on is that Torgersen is incoherent. He's noticed things that could be construed as real problems (small worldcon attendance &amp; voting relative to the popular interest in sci-fi, the -perceived- declining relevance of the Hugo) and to try and fix them by expanding the culture he's joined up with a project that explicitly started as an act of political trolling. He's fronted a slate that, while ostensibly constructed democratically, is largely made up of candidates <em>not</em> picked out by the comments on the post where he asked for suggestions.<br>
<br>
It's a mishmash. It's gobbledygook. And I'm so perplexed because he doesn't seem to see that or want to address those issues. Say what you want about Vox Day and Larry Correia, but at least they were honest about their aim of commandeering votes.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021066" target="_self">9:43 AM</a>  on April 24, 2015

		<a name="6021168"></a><div class="comments">Ancillary Justice is quite popular, incidentally - it's sold about 3 times as many copies as the average book.  I think that's why the Puppies keep pointing to Amazon reviews; it's the one place where they seem to have an edge.  It doesn't seem to occur to them that a work could be both popular and controversial, or popular and divisive, which would affect those scores.<br>
<br>
The Catcher in the Rye, which has sold around 65,000,000 copies total and sells 250,000 every year, has a lower Amazon review score than Ancillary Justice, or for that matter any of the novels either the Puppies or the majority of the voters got on the ballot.  I guess it must be "less popular".<br>
<br>
And yeah, Torgensen's blog in particular tends to make my head spin.  He really wants words to mean whatever he wants them to mean.  E.g. (I'm paraphrasing here, but really not by much):<br>
<br>
We tried doing it 'their way' and got nowhere! = We tried winning by getting enough votes but we couldn't get enough votes.<br>
<br>
So we decided to bring in more Democracy! = So we figured out how to exploit the rules so that 15% of the votes would dominate 70% of the ballot.<br>
<br>
And Transparency! = I looked at a few suggestions but mostly picked whatever I felt like.<br>
<br>
We only did openly what has been going on behind the scenes for years! = The numbers pretty much prove that no one has done this ever before.<br>
<br>
So they're mad because we let in the 'proles' and the 'wrong kind' of voters! = People are pissed because we figured out how to exploit the rules so that 15% of the votes would dominate 70% of the ballot.<br>
<br>
It's dizzying.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021168" target="_self">10:43 AM</a>  on April 24, 2015

I'd say three wins -- The Vor Game, Barrayar, Mirror Dance.

		<a name="6021745"></a><div class="comments">Having read some of Torgersen's comments on his own posts, I can flesh out his perspective a bit more.
<ul>
<li>Torgersen knows about <em>at least</em> twelve campaigns for Hugos: <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/nail-house/#comment-7948">"I’ve been doing this [going to sci-fi cons and writing?] for five years, and I’ve encountered no less than one dozen campaigns of various types. From the “buddy up” campaign surrounding <em>Chicks Dig Time Lords</em> to the campaign to get <em>Red Shirts</em> a best novel win, to the engineering of “socially conscious” voting that depends entirely on the sexuality, gender, and ethnicity of the author or the author’s characters."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/nail-house/#comment-8030">“The Water That Falls On You From Nowhere” was a very up-front [“stick it to people who want science fiction or fantasy in their science fiction and fantasy”] story, in the same manner [as “If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love”]."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/catching-up-with-charles-e-gannon/#comment-7861">"Don't kid yourself [that SFWA isn't prejudiced against conservative writers [just because they nominated Chuck Gannon for a Nebula]. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day."</a></li>
<li>Lois McMaster Bujold and Mike Resnick haven't won Hugos <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/hugo-losers-speech/#comment-5340">in ten years</a>; this is due to an unfair shift in the zeitgeist against them.</li>
<li>Mike Reznick was <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/sp3-solomon/#comment-9278">slandered</a> during the SFWA Bulletin affair.</li>
<li>The Honor Harrington series and the 1632 series have been <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-4/#comment-4854">unjustly overlooked</a> for Hugo nominations.</li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-5-sad-puppies-2-post-mortem/#comment-5440">"The literature world has been forever spinning its wheels about what “good” writing looks like, and everyone has a different opinion. What can’t be faked is good storytelling. Something which both Eric Flint and David Drake agree is in much shorter supply, than “good” writing."</a> (This is interesting because Torgersen also very much believes that "taste" is always both subjective and entirely justified.)</li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-5-sad-puppies-2-post-mortem/#comment-5405">"[T]he honest truth is that Larry Correia’s work stands a high probability of being read and appreciated in 20 years, by a very broad spectrum of readers. The same cannot be said of (for example) a piece like, “The Water That Falls on You From Nowhere.” That’s a piece targeted to a very specific kind of reader with a very specific kind of taste, and the flat, hard truth of it is… there just aren’t very many people like that out in the big marketplace. Not in comparison to the number of readers for a <em>Warbound</em> or a <em>Monster Hunter</em> series book."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-5-sad-puppies-2-post-mortem/#comment-5405">"To <em>me</em> [the word "pulp"] connotes classic, visceral storytelling that is action-filled and tends to have a lot of colorful, larger-than-life characters who engage in larger-than-life adventures. <em>Indiana Jones</em> being a very good example of what I’d call contemporary pulp done on film. I do not think a book like <em>Red Shirts</em> is pulp, as much as it is ambitious fan fiction. Because <em>Red Shirts</em> is far, far too conscious of the audience."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/fear-and-loathing-at-the-awards-table-4/#comment-4567">"Most of the (tiny group) of people who are dead set against me, have been dead set against me for a long time. Going all the way back to when I defended the racial diversity of the Battlestar Galactica reboot."</a> (This is from back in 2014, immediately after SP2, but gives a better perspective on his perception of the fight.)</li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/nail-house/#comment-7939">"[I agree that most of the "big names" in sci-fi aren't attacking the sad puppies], and most of the big names get shunned by the Hugos anyway, because being “too successful” is a huge strike against you with the TruFen. You have to ride that sweet spot: selling just enough to be a big fish in a small bowl, but never, ever selling well enough to actually get traction in the mainstream. Beyond Worldcon, beyond academic leftist circles. And Lord help you if you ever write a game or tie-in book. That’s kiss of death right there. The unforgivable sin."</a> (This is from March 29, pre-everything blowing up; his perspective might be the same.)</li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/we-are-not-rabid/#comment-11176">"Also: since when did “GamerGate” become bogeyword for “All evil in the known universe”??"</a> (Although I have misplaced the link, Torgersen -at least, at one point- relied on Vox Day to provide much of his perspective on GG.)
*<a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/flaming-rage-nozzles-of-tolerance/#comment-10299">"K. Tempest Bradford and Nora Jemisin get away with what they do, because progressive white folk are too nervous to take on people who will accuse them of racism; and according to the “rules” of critical race theory, the brown person can never be wrong."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/sad-puppies-3-were-they-contacted/#comment-9929">"It’s entirely accurate that if I published with anyone other than Baen, I probably could not do [Sad Puppies 3]. No way. Most of the other publishers’ editors all came out of TruFandom, and right now TruFandom’s self-selected mouthpieces are very unhappy with me."</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/unpersoning">"These are broken souls – Vox, and his arch-enemies — but they are still human beings."</a> (I think this is the strongest language he uses to describe Vox.)</li>
<li>The Millenials aren't all right: <a href="https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/fort-living-room/#comment-9087">"I see Chu was born in 1984.

		<a name="6021810"></a><div class="comments"><em>The Honor Harrington series and the 1632 series have been unjustly overlooked for Hugo nominations.</em><br>
<br>
To be fair, I actually agree with him on this one, at least. The 1632 books are phenomenally written with a lot of historical fleshing out and nuance - some of the better alternate history I've read, up there with Turtledove. The Honor Harrington books are likewise truly excellent mil-SF with a greater attention to detail than usually seen, with a rich world-grounding.<br>
<br>
Now, this doesn't map totally on conventional left-right breakdowns - for example, the 1632 series showcases a group of union organizers - but Southern redneck union organizers, albeit a somewhat diverse set. There are strong women - but most of the strong women ultimately become partnered with other strong men, including kind of nerd archetypes. The world is rich, complex, and nuanced - but they also survive because of their good old-fashioned American values and training and ingenuity. <br>
<br>
So I think there are really good questions to be asked - why hasn't the 1632 series secured some nominations? What is it about it that has not appealed to the Hugo voting population, which is a very small subset of the spec-fic population? And it's natural to ask these questions, even if you don't have the answers.<br>
<br>
Likewise, Honor Harrington is a strong woman, whose mother is a sex-positive bioengineer. A major, major part of the storyline actually involves overcoming the fuddy-duddy religious bigot's feelings about her being in charge of things because she's a woman. Another portion showcases her sexual assault and taking justice for it. But she embodies traditionally 'masculine' values about war and combat and leading troops, has a conservative pro-military bent, and the liberals (aside from the anti slavers) kind of look like peace-at-any-price clowns. <br>
<br>
So why hasn't the Harrington series been nominated? It's an important question. And why is it perceived as conservative -even by Torgensen - even though it has some fairly strong themes about diversity?<br>
<br>
Personally, I think it may be about cultural overlap with political positions more than with actual political positions. Because 1632 has a lot of 'Good Old Boys', it is coded as conservative even though it has revolutionaries throwing bombs all over the place. Because Honor Harrington has 'the woman who is One Of The Boys', it's coded as conservative, despite the polyamorous relationships. <br>
<br>
And I am beginning to think that if there is anti-conservative prejudice - just like anti-liberal prejudice, it's more about signaling and culture than about true politics. Because again - how is Honor Harrington coded as conservative to conservatives, even though it hits half of the 'SJW' points? That's a really important nut to crack.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021810" target="_self">4:22 PM</a>  on April 24, 2015

I know people of goodwill are trying to reframe this as evil Vox Day leading things astray, and it's not. Vox Day is an evil bastard, sure, but these are people who have cuddled up to him for years and don't see anything wrong with a guy who referred to the children Anders Breivik murdered as "invaders and quislings of his homeland" and who expects him to be "one day revered by Norwegians".  <br>

<br>
Ha. Somebody tell Barbara Hambly about that one. If I see one of her tie-ins in a used bookstore I will snap that right up, because she can make any franchise readable. (Most recently enjoyed: her novelization of the Beauty and the Beast TV show.) This does not lessen my respect for anything else she's written, and same applies to plenty of other authors who've done excellent tie-ins, like Diane Duane.<br>
<br>
I'm seeing a lot of flailing about for nefarious reasons that works don't get nominated or win, when it merits more of a shrug and a "zeitgeist, what can you do?" No matter how much I like a series, I'm unlikely to nominate or vote for a later volume in the series, because how often does it happen that later volumes are better? As someone who used past Hugo award-winners as a reading list growing up, why would I want to direct other readers to books that don't make a good starting point? I like the rule allowing nomination of a complete series, and hope it'll get used for something other than Wheel of Time (which I am a fan of, but that nom really felt like a combo "sorry you're dead"/"congrats on actually finishing it somehow" thing.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100236" target="_self">asperity</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021846" target="_self">4:52 PM</a>  on April 24, 2015

Since I'm babbling about Bujold, four of the books that she didn't get nominated for in the last decade were a fantasy/romance experiment.

That's it right there. It isn't like we can go back in time and nominate things even if we discover them later, either. (Retro Hugos excepted.)

I mostly am trying to look at all the data. It's obvious the Hugos have some problems - hell, even Jo Walton in her Tor series, when she was being incredibly generous, could only get to '70% of the hugo wins deserved to be there.'. I am even coming to some of my own conclusions, but I'm trying hard not to let them sink until I finish others years, which at least for short story/novella stuff should be this weekend. I'm also picking up some novels for KIndle.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021926" target="_self">5:39 PM</a>  on April 24, 2015

Bujold didn't get any wins for Cryoburn and Lord Vortapill because they don't really stand on their own. They elaborate on dramatic problems and comic foibles previously introduced. And while they're fun, readable, and I've given both as gifts to friends who are also fans of the series, that doesn't make them Hugo-worthy.<br>

Which is something that Torgersen and Correia just don't get. There's lots of fun, readable, and bestselling stuff that isn't award-worthy.

Sure. Individual voters are generally not as well-informed about the year's publications as they might like to be (or imagine others to be), and they can feel shy about nominating. I don't think I ever nominated in the off-and-on years I've voted -- I didn't feel qualified. Which is of course bullshit as evidenced by this year, but that's how it was for me. I can't imagine I'm alone there given the stats.<br>
<br>
So much of it's just luck, who a small group of people heard of, read, and thought to nominate in a given year, and then what each of those nominations is up against. And until recently, there wasn't a super-convenient way to read all the works nominated in a year.

<br>
I've only read the first couple, but I would think that the biggest reason is that alt-history isn't sufficiently popular -- you compared the series to Turtledove, who has zero nominations (for novels anyway).  A second reason for that series is that, at least in the first couple of books, it's going through the same setup and issues that Stirling's Nantucket books did.<br>
<br>
But I agree that how things get coded as liberal or conservative isn't always obvious or clear.  I think the Honor Harrington books aren't as good an example -- in spite of not being about white dudes, the story is still about conflicts with a Big Bad Empire that has to eat its neighbors because it has a social welfare state, because obviously you couldn't just fund one with taxation, and one that's presented as deeply morally corrupting.

<br>
My impression at the time -- totally anecdotal -- was that it was historical fiction people reading 1632 the year it came out, not SFF people. None of my SFF friends had even heard of it but all my history-reading friends were BIG into it, especially as it was a break from all the "What if the Nazis won?" alternative history that was the bulk of the alternative history genre at the time. It was in with the historical fiction new releases at the library, too. My SFF friends didn't really twig to it until a couple of years later.<br>
<br>
(And count me among those who thought the subsequent books got a little bit dull and diffuse ... loved the first one, was pretty meh on later volumes, although I thought the problem was there was just TOO  MUCH HISTORY and he was so determined to be encyclopedic in how the even would have reverberated throughout the world -- both a virtue and a vice when it comes to writing.)<br>

But also, my literary fiction book club looks at a lot of awards shortlists and winners to pick our books for the year, so I've read my way through a lot of Pulitzer, Booker, etc., awards lists over the past 10 years or so, and there are always books that you're like, "HOW DID THIS NOT WIN?" and others that you're like, "WHY DID THIS EVEN GET NOMINATED UGH IT IS TERRIBLE." The Booker in the late 90s often made me want to PUNCH things because the shortlists were often TERRIBLE and full of utterly nonsensical pretentiousness. And some years the Pulitzer shortlist is a collection of absolute gems and other years it's a big pile of meh. Sometimes that seems to be the judges' preferences; sometimes it seems to be what was published that year. "Catch-22" lost to "The Edge of Sadness" which like nobody's even heard of. "The Great Gatsby" lost to "Arrowsmith," which is actually a book I love, but has obviously not made the same mark as Gatsby. I'd enthusiastically recommend Arrowsmith -- it is fascinating and lovely and totally worth reading -- but it is a SAFE choice that is firmly within the genre of American realism at the time, and while it tackles some really big themes (how to live the idealistic pursuit of science and medicine in the real world, essentially, in big ways that were just starting to be important and impactful when it was written) and it's gorgeously written, it doesn't go nearly as big as Gatsby's commentary on America-qua-America or the ways Fitzgerald pushed narrative and language. But Gatsby is a much bigger leap and the Pulitzer committee that year couldn't recognize it for what it was; they were too close to it. <br>
<br>
Awards can always be better and I'm not saying we shouldn't look to improve them, but yearly awards are necessarily short-sighted and they're never going to hit on the "best" book for that year more than 25% of the time, and at least 25% of the time they're going to choose a total stinker.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, other people's taste in books is a foreign country with bad plumbing.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6022167" target="_self">8:27 PM</a>  on April 24, 2015

		<a name="6022182"></a><div class="comments">Re the 1632 and Honor Harrington books, corb, I'd have to argue that while they can be entertaining, the longer the series goes on the less well written and entertaining they are.  Don't get me wrong, I buy books from both series, if for no other reason than to find out what happens next (I do, however, buy them on kindle so that no-one will see the godawful covers they're plagued by: Baen seems to have an 'anti-design' department). But honestly, I can think of 3 or four of the 1632 books which end almost mid-sentence: no resolution, no nothing.  You just have to wait a year or two to find out if someone is alive or dead, or if the Walathians actually started the invasion or not.  And the Honor books have way too many words.  I sometimes wonder if  David W. gets paid like Dickens on a per-word basis.  In a couple of his last books, I've actually noticed where he  uses the exact same language to describe the exact same scene in separate novels.  The man desperately needs an editor.<br>
<br>
And if we're discussing overlooked books, I could just as easily point to Elizabeth Moon and Martha Wells. Moon published 12 Mil SF books between 1993 and 2008 and AFAIK didn't get a single nomination, notwithstanding the fact (or my opinion at least) that her prose is tighter, tauter and more engaging than Weber's.  And that's before the Islam blog thing blew up, which was a around 2010 or so, if I remember correctly.  Until then, she'd generally been seen as progressive.   But her books are more about space-fighting women marines and exploding rockets driven by characters with ladyparts, and thus suspect, I guess.<br>
<br>
And Martha Wells, jesus.  She's written nothing that hasn't impressed the living hell out of me.  Her <em>Ile Rien</em> books are some pre-steampunk steampunk with magic and dirigibles and alternate worlds and just plain fabulous stories which combine deeply layered characters with Indiana Jones adventures.  And she's been totally ignored since 1998 when she got a Nebula nomination.<br>
<br>
And finally, Walter Jon Williams, who has done everything from first-gen cyberpunk to near future noir-ish mysteries to massive space battle Mil SF to fantasy masked as science fiction, and who hasn't got a single fucking nomination  (that I can remember).<br>
<br>
All three of these writers have put out stuff that is (OK, OK, in my opinion) way better and more thought-provoking than Flint or Weber.  And like I said, I buy Flint and Weber's stuff.  All I'm saying is that claiming there's a bias against conservative SF ignores the fact that there are lots and lots of REALLY GOOD writers who haven't received awards or even nominations., even though their politics skew liberal-ish.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/221603" target="_self">my dog is named clem</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6022182" target="_self">8:41 PM</a>  on April 24, 2015

		<a name="6022265"></a><div class="comments">It would be pretty easy for me to name a dozen brilliant authors of left-ish books who have never been nominated for a Hugo.  A dozen may be underestimating things.  A lot.  In fact, I'm going to look to directly to my right at my "Ki through La" shelf, which is handily beside my desk, and see what I find JUST THERE.<br>
<br>
Here are all the sci-fi and fantasy authors sitting around there:<br>
<br>
Caitlin Kiernan<br>
Rosemary Kirstein<br>
Alethea Kontis<br>
Mary Robinette Kowal - Hugo nominee and winner!<br>
Elizabeth Knox<br>
Ellen Kushner<br>
Mur Lafferty - Campbell award nominee and winner!<br>
Larissa Lai<br>
Laura Lam<br>
Justine Larbalestier - Hugo nominee!<br>
<br>
So, why do the Hugos ignore 1632 and Honor Harrington?  I don't know.  Why did they ignore The Drowning Girl?  The Steerswoman?  Enchanted?  Dreamhunter?  Swordspoint?  Salt Fish Girl?  Pantomime?<br>
<br>
It's not like these are obscure works.  The Drowning Girl won the Tiptree and the Stoker and was nominated for just about everything including a Nebula.  Salt Fish Girl was shortlisted for the Tiptree.  Dreamhunter won an ALA.  The Steerswoman and Swordspoint and Pantomime were all books I got because everyone I knew was raving about how great they were.  And if the Hugos really are looking to become some kind of diversity checklist, most if not all of these books would tick an awful lot of boxes.<br>
<br>
So, that's one shelf.<br>
<br>
I have forty-two shelves.<br>
<br>
So I really have to think that pointing to any individual work or author doesn't prove much.  Sure, there might be trends.  If the numbers were crunched, I believe we might see that alt-history, or YA, or long series don't get nominated a lot.  But frankly, if someone tries to prove a trend by saying, "Prominent author X has never even been nominated!", the appropriate reaction is probably to shrug and say, "Well, they can get in line."<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6022265" target="_self">9:46 PM</a>  on April 24, 2015

		<a name="6022544"></a><div class="comments"><cite>"why hasn't the 1632 series secured some nominations? What is it about it that has not appealed to the Hugo voting population, which is a very small subset of the spec-fic population?"</cite><br>
<br>
Because it's decent, but not that good, not even on the level of S. M. Stirling's <cite>Island in the Sea of Times</cite> series, which really the SJWs unfairly overlooked for starring a black, lesbian Coast Guard captain educating the barenaked savages of Great Britain on their treatment of women. <small>Course, it also involved the "ironic" rape of a Foolish Environmentalist by a panther, so...</small><br>
<br>
But the Real Truth is that you have five slots for best novel each year and on average anywhere from 1,000 to 1500 or so new SFF books published each year.  That's why the Hugos so often can feel out of touch and have done so for decades, because the SFF field has become so incredibly splintered. Up until the mid to late seventies it was more or less possible to keep up with the whole of science fiction, so the Hugos could and did represent the whole of it. <br>
<br>
This is of course no longer possible and combine that with the inherent small c-conservatism of the Hugo voting base (get nominated once significantly increases your chances of future nominations) and whole generations of writers can get ignored. <br>
<br>
Ironically, last year's awards, save for the Puppy nonsense on it, could be said to be more in touch with the tastes of SFF as whole, considering how <cite>Ancillary Justice</cite> swept every major SF award, something never done before. <br>
<br>
What the Puppies have done is replace the naturally grown limited outlook of the Hugo voters with their own artificially restricted view. Big improvement.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6022544" target="_self">5:55 AM</a>  on April 25, 2015

You know, anybody who'd like to get a good grasp of the future of science fiction and fantasy, <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6021763">that list of writers</a> is where you'd start.  None of the people mentioned there is a bad writer. <br>
<br>
And you know, Torgersen (or James "not the Top Gear bloke fortunately" May, who collected that list) is not entirely wrong when he says that people like  Jim Hines or N.K. Jemisin have become prominent within SFF and fandom as much for their "activism" as for their writing; it's just that they think it's a <em>bad thing</em>.  <br>
<br>
For me personally it's the opposite: writers who are passionate about making science fiction more diverse, more open to people of colour, LGBT, women, etc are also writers much more likely to write innovative, diverse and open science fiction. I've been buying a lot of books, reading a lot of stories, based on how people behaved online and so far I've rarely been disappointed. <br>
<br>
That idea that progressive politics automatically means bad writing is of course a right wing shibboleth, but just wrong. If anything, it's doctrinaire rightwing politics in a novel that stifles creative writing, and not just because my ox is gored. <br>
<br>
Things like having thinly disguised versions of contemporary politicians be the bad guys in your space opera, or an incessant need to sneer at some political position <em>which has no relevance for your far future setting whatsoever</em> is something rightwing authors  indulge in far more often than leftwing ones. <br>
<br>
A weird list though, mixing in as it does writers, critics and bloggers, both political and apolitical and why list Jim Hines and not the Great Satan himself, John Scalzi?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6022550" target="_self">6:18 AM</a>  on April 25, 2015

That's not their true wish - they want THEIR version of science fiction and fantasy to be the most popular, and they want to use dominating the Hugos as a part of the process of creating that. And failing that, just controlling the established Hugos to provide an awards system for their own little Balkanized sub-genre of the genre.<br>

Or just sounding more like the CEO of a publishing company who knows how to build a business. I'm generally a little more hopeful now that I may be wrong about my previous prediction that the Rabid Wolves will end up owning the Hugos, but when I hear VD smartly 'moderating himself', I get more skeptical of the general assessment of him as a "fringe nut".<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6023046" target="_self">7:32 PM</a>  on April 25, 2015

<br>
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Hugo many voters would be pleased to vote a media tie-in to the award. If the TV series gets ahead of the novels, Game of Thrones books will very nearly count. But I think there's still a lot of love in fandom for classic media tie-ins by Diane Duane, Janet Kagan, John M. Ford, and Barbara Hambly. I hear relatively recent tie-ins by David Mack, Kirsten Beyer, and Karen Traviss are decent (I've read one novel and sampled two by them--they were OK and might fit Correia's idea of good SF fairly well). Recent and two-time Campbell nominee Max Gladstone has just signed on to write a Pathfinder book. MeFi's own Hogshead has written both Warhammer and Sonic the Hedgehog novels and deserves only kudos for trying to do interesting things with them. <br>
<br>
But tie-ins face a ton of structural problems in getting recognition: they're usually deep in a series/setting that not all fans have liked in other regards; authors are constrained by both time and by what's OK to do and/or change in the series; authors likely don't have much incentive to put their hearts and souls into properties they don't entirely own; quite a lot of tie-in books, even by well-known authors, simply aren't that great; and given the foregoing, it would take a lot of noise from the niche reading a book to get a wide audience to believe in it and try it out in time to nominate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/93769" target="_self">Monsieur Caution</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6023072" target="_self">7:54 PM</a>  on April 25, 2015

<br>
I have spent a silly amount of time going through the Brad Torgersen's material looking for quotes that can establish his position on things. While I think that he has made some precise statements (authors have campaigned for their and other work, some works have won because of affirmative action / the public statements of their authors rather than on their own merits, fandom isn't representative enough), in general his descriptions of the motivation behind the puppies has never really added up to explaining why Sad Puppies was a good fix for anything.<br>
<br>
Getting caught up in the weeds of figuring out just what Torgersen believes is driving me nuts.  To steal a comment on Sandifer's blog post, I'm letting Torgersen live rent free in my head, and that's a problem. The puppies have no more concrete motivation than GG (especially when you consider the crossover) and thinking about the details of why this or that novel didn't get a Hugo is missing the point. I should put all this drama down and go read all the Iain Banks that I've wanted to get to.<br>

<br>
Yeah, to be clear, I in no way think this is unique to the Hugos, it's just that with the balkanization of fandom, you're getting people who are like WHAT I CANNOT EVEN CONCEIVE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE HUGO SIR, which kind of drives me crazy from an accuracy standpoint. As many people have noted, the awards were more likely to produce the kind of 'epically best' books when the field was small enough that everyone could read everything. Now the field is huge. If I go to the bookstore, it's a crapshoot, and I'm likely to choose authors I've read before, which means I'm more likely to think their work is best. Some other people might be choosing by diversity methods. Other people might be looking at recommended reading lists, authors who are active on Livejournal or Baen's Bar, rolling some dice - what I'm trying to say is that the field is large enough that your method of finding good books is necessarily going to be straw-in-a-haystack behavior and <em>whatever</em> you do, you're going to be missing some good stuff. <br>
<br>
And sometimes we have reading behavior that isn't exactly super "fair" - for example, it is now a matter of record that I hated Hundred Thousand Kingdoms. But it was recommended at a lot of places that I hang out, largely for its diversity perspective. But because I didn't like it, that means I don't trust those people to recommend again, which may mean I'm missing out on some truly great diverse stuff by less known authors, simply because those recommend lists are dead to me and other recommend lists aren't suggesting or reading them. And I see that problem, but I don't even have a solution, because books are a nontrivial expense at the speed I read and I am no longer a teenager who can hang out in a Borders reading the first few chapters of a work.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6023657" target="_self">2:08 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

		<a name="6023771"></a><div class="comments">I actually haven't seen the Puppies complaining about the rules.  The main complaint about the rules has been coming from the other side, namely that the nomination process is too vulnerable to what the Puppies did.<br>
<br>
While there have been some complaints about "secret slates" or whatnot from the Puppy side, it hasn't really been a rules issue -- in fact, they seem pretty against any changes to the rules; as far as I can tell, they tend to view proposed rules changes, even ones that would affect everyone equally, as attempts to shut them out.<br>
<br>
They've mainly been focusing their complaints on the composition of Worldcon Hugo voters.  They say that the number of voters is tiny, and that this has allowed it to be overrun with people who are not representative of fandom as a whole.  There have been a lot of comparisons to much larger conventions (Comicon comes up a lot).<br>
<br>
To be fair, the first part of the complaint (the number of voters is tiny) is something I have heard many people grouse about for years.<br>
<br>
However, the Puppies' approach to solving these problems, real and/or perceived -- which is to say, "Give all power to an even tinier minority subset of the voting pool" -- has, let's say, failed to impress me.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6023771" target="_self">4:08 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

<br>
Amazon buying non-English genre fiction and offering English translations through their Amazon Publishing arm has, anecdotally, been dramatically increasing the availability of European authors (in particular) in the US. They're picking from a broader pool than "critically acclaimed" or "Nobel possible" and have been offering rapid-selling genre and pop fiction. Already since January I've read recently-released books originally written in Norwegian, Dutch, and Finnish, plus two that were some eminently forgettable Bulgarian archer fantasy thing, but, hey! I paid $1.99 on Kindle Daily Deal, and they were no more or less forgettable than other low-grade SFF! But this is way more foreign-language fiction than I've ever had ACCESS to, and it's so delightful that some of it has been written in the last couple years instead of "okay it's been 20 years and everyone still loves it, I GUESS we should offer it in translation to the Americans." Now something catches my eye on the Kindle Daily Deal for SFF, and I read the description and at the bottom it says, "Originally published in Bulgarian" or whatever and I'm like, "Oh, huh, I've never read anything from Bulgaria, and I like archers, I should check it out!" I know they're fishing for the next Stieg Larsson but that's okay! I don't mind! IT IS AN ENTIRE NEW WORLD.<br>
<br>
<small>(The Norwegian and Dutch ones weren't SFF -- the Dutch one was "The Dinner" of course -- but I really enjoyed them and have been widely recommending them. The Finnish one, which I'm in the middle of, is SFF, and I'll definitely suggest to my SFF friends. Also if anyone wants to argue about "The Dinner" memail me because my husband is WRONGETY WRONG WRONG about it and I need to DISCUSS.)</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" target="_self">Eyebrows McGee</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6023849" target="_self">5:30 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

<br>
Call it my naivete, but I don't think anyone looks at the hats in front of them and puts the black hat on. I really don't think that they think they're trying to give the power to the minority subset. I legitimately, 100% believe that they think they're speaking for the 'silent majority'. Now whether that's accurate or not, that's another story. But I believe they are true recounters of the things that have happened to them. I have been over to Baen's Bar and seen people saying 'Yes! Thank you for sticking it to Those Guys!' I readily believe that they receive at least a few emails saying 'Thank you, I've been afraid to say X, but you alone are fighting the good fight.'<br>
<br>
I say this, because it has<em> happened to me</em>. Now, I'm not idiotic enough to think that my general views are more than minority view here on Metafilter. But I definitely, even in my more unusual ideas, almost always get messages saying 'Thank you for speaking for me, I would be afraid to say that publicly.''<br>
<br>
And you know, if I weren't a hardcore veteran of activism and deeply familiar with how seductive that pull is, it would act far harder on me than it does. And these guys aren't. This is, by all internet accounts, their first foray into any kind of Big Fight. And you are hardwired to respond to a fight with adrenaline. Every time someone says something Wrong on the Internet, your centers start kicking up fight hormone so you physically start feeling like it's more important than it is. And every time someone says 'Thank you for sticking up for me' you have to work hard not to feel like a goddamn hero. You have to really be self aware. And that is a learned skill, not an inborn one.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6023925" target="_self">7:08 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

I grew up with a very hateful, racist, sexist, assholish father, who I treated with respect (I had to for my own safety). I said <em>"Hey, I see where you are. Have you thought about this? We're all friends here."</em> a lot of times and it never helped him change his mind. I learned that such an approach was only seen as a sign of weakness from his kind. The only things that ever made him change his mind on anything was (1) to come up with something that he could consider 'in his best interest' or (2) to make him THINK something was in his best interest by lying about it. <br>
<br>
Understanding him, knowing what he went through in his own life and how it shaped him, didn't help. Ultimately, I had to give up trying to love him like a father and just accept him as someone I couldn't cut ties with. And if it doesn't work on a relationship that close, how do apply it to people in the business of selling what they write?

I have no doubt they do.  But I was discussing their actions, not their intentions.  Sorry if that was unclear.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't be pissed if they'd thought that and gone with "big recruitment drive for the Hugos, vote for the SFF of your choice and let your voice be heard!"  I wouldn't be pissed if they'd gone with, "the rules should be changed to a 3/8 nomination process so the people we think are secretly controlling it can no longer do so!"<br>
<br>
Instead, they went with the slate thing, which is "let's do a thing where a tiny minority gets to dictate the whole ballot", so I'm pissed.<br>
<br>
If their thing is that they think they speak for a majority, they can prove it by getting a majority.  Anything else means that they might think they're all about democracy and majority and expanding the voter base, but they're acting like people who lost a vote a couple years running and decided they should win anyway.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6024048" target="_self">9:02 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

And they do speak for a large 'silent constituency', most of whom don't buy SFF books. More likely to buy Tom Clancy thrillers or Bill O'Reilly "historicals". If they can tap into that audience, they're gonna sell a shitton of books. And if they can show "yeah, you hate SFF and 'the SFF establishment', but we just kicked them out and we're gonna give you what you like!"<br>

Even with a record number of voters for this year's Hugos... 7000+ at last count, with 3000+ attending Sasquan, it's still a tiny percentage of SFF Fandom. And if smartly managed (a big if), they actually could take what was learned from Vox Day's SFWA booting, the first two Sad Puppies campaigns and the failed 'Honey Badger' invasion at Calgary to accomplish the takeover I spoke of before.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/20007" target="_self">oneswellfoop</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6024074" target="_self">9:27 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

Everyone with them is a brave free thinker, everyone against them is marching in lockstep. It's quite ironic, given how many plaintive howls (see what I did there) we've heard from the puppies about tribalism and "wrongfan".<br>

I hope you're right, eriko, but I've seen the big-buck fundraisers for the businesses the got in trouble for declaring open discrimination against gays, and if they could get $100K+, well, that much buys 2500 Hugo Votes.

<br>
The same thing people have done in a wide variety of similar situations for decades - openly speak up against their limited and bigoted worldview (and these days "speaking up" certainly includes blog posts and tweets and FB posts and internet commentary). You will likely not change the minds of the ringleaders, but observers who may be undecided or uncertain will see that the bigots do not necessarily truly represent a "silent majority." Some of those people will go on to speak up against such bigotry themselves.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you have to actually use the democratic process to create and enforce rules that will reduce the ability of the bigoted to affect the lives of those they are bigoted against.  In this case, that would involve becoming a member of  WorldCon and voting, and possibly changing the nominating rules to reduce the chance of this happening again.<br>
<br>
No murdering is necessary. Nor is it necessary to somehow try to see their points.  They may have sincere beliefs, but their sincere beliefs don't outweigh <em>my</em> sincere belief that what they believe is morally repugnant.<br>
<br>
<em>understand that everyone is trying to be a good person the best they know how</em><br>
<br>
Except the problem here is that the ringleaders of this fiasco - Torgersen, Correia, and Beale - have <em><strong>extremely</strong></em> limited definitions of "good person." Many people are unable to be "good" by their definition because of genetics. And they have such an authoritarian take on the world that if you're not a "good person" as they define it, you are <em><strong>so</strong></em> "bad" that they feel morally justified in doing whatever they can to stop you. I can recognize that they may be acting out of sincere beliefs, and still recognize that they are fanatics who are unable or unwilling to compromise, and any attempt to "meet them in the middle" is a fool's errand. <br>
<br>
<em>Saying, "Hey, I see where you are. Have you thought about this? We're all friends here." is the only way I have ever known anyone to truly change their mind about anything.</em><br>
<br>
This would be a valid point if anyone was interested in changing the minds of Torgersen, Correia, or Beale. But they're not. People are angry about a tiny minority gaming the awards system as part of a culture war.  Changing the minds of the instigators &amp; participants in the slate nominations is very low on the list of things people want to do, so arguing that the Anti-Puppies should approach this in a spirit of compromise is missing the point of the goals of the people angry about the PuppySlate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/145062" target="_self">soundguy99</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6024140" target="_self">11:10 PM</a>  on April 26, 2015

		<a name="6024296"></a><div class="comments"><i>And for those of us who are a little short on money right now, when is the deadline for buying our Sasquan memberships?</i><br>
<br>
In terms of voting on the Final Hugo ballot, the ballot will close July 1st, so some time before that. How much before depends on how well the web ballot is working, it could be as soon as "seconds" to "a day" before. <br>
<br>
If you want to attend, there's no deadline, but the sooner you purchase, the less the cost will be for an attending membership.  <br>
<br>
The reason for this -- money in the bank sooner is much more useful to the concom, because they know they have it. At-doors are always an unknown factor, so they can't spend too much of that money hoping you'll show up then, and if a whole bunch show up at-door, there's not much they can do with the money other than consuite. if those same people by attending memberships well before, they can plan on more involved things with that budget. <br>
<br>
This, by the way, is universally true of the Worldcon. The cheapest way to get an attending without dealing with the bidding process is to vote, then convert within 90 days to attending. Note that it doesn't matter who you vote for, the vote fee makes you a supporting member of whatever bid wins the Worldcon, and there's a flat conversion to attending. At con, there's usually a line.<br>
<br>
Now, with the bids, you can sometimes get in a hair cheaper. To support the bid, many bids have "pre-supporting" memberships, which are basically donations to the bid. Some give you a cut on your conversion. Some bids also have "Friends of the bid", which are substantially more expensive, but if you're a friend and the bid wins, you auto convert to attending, and in some cases, the cost of being a friend of a bid + the voting fee is less than the voting fee + the conversion fee. The kicker is that if the bid you're a "friend" of doesn't win, you don't convert. That deal is with that bid only.<br>
<br>
So, for simplicity's sake, just ignore that until you've been going for a while -- or if it's an obvious race, like an unopposed bid and the math says being a friend is cheaper than the conversion. That happened in 2005 when the Glasgow bid was running unopposed and the conversion fee was $105, but the friend of the bid fee was $100. Glasgow had a *lot* of friends.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6024296" target="_self">8:23 AM</a>  on April 27, 2015

Obviously we're not mind-readers, but the actions of the Puppies are not the actions of sincere yet misguided people. There's been no democracy, no transparency among their group.

<br>
Well, Correia and Torgersen display the baseline amount of racism and homophobia of the conservative base (which, let's admit, is pretty high), so there's that. And I have no problem calling Correia misogynist and transphobic, given his rhetoric over Sarkeesian/Quinn/Wu (and harassment in general) and his nasty lashing out over Tor's posting of an article promoting writing outside the gender binary. Torgersen I could kinda-sorta believe had good intentions (although so many other writers had essentially demolished the entire basis of his arguments), up until the point at which he signed on with the gators. Once you start talking up how well-meaning and honest the demonstrably racist/misogynist/etc lynch mob is, and welcoming them to your attempts to destroy something you don't like, I believe "good intentions" have gone right out the window.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6024351" target="_self">9:48 AM</a>  on April 27, 2015

<br>
If the Hugo Admin honors the withdrawal, and someone ranks them, they'll just move to the next spot on the ballot. <br>
<br>
If they don't, they'll just count the ballots as if nothing has changed. After the first round, if nobody has a clear majority, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, those ballots move to their next choice and redistribute, and we recount. If that doesn't give us a majority, we knock out the lowest remaining, and do it again. <br>
<br>
We keep doing that until we have a majority. That's the preliminary winner. We then run another pass, but only two candidates are in this one, the preliminary winner and No Award. If No Award wins here, no award is given. If not, the preliminary winner is confirmed. <br>
<br>
For reasons, for which I will only describe as "dumb", people then insist on running the election for 2nd, which you do by running it all again but ignoring the winner and the No Award test. The winner of that comes in 2nd. You repeat for 3rd through 6th, No Award counts as just another entrant. I personally find this a bunch of noise that we never did until we wrote software to do the counting, and some FUCKING NERD had to write the code to run all that, and I hate that person so much. Back before that person, we counted with paper ballots, moved them between piles, and didn't bother with anything but the important one. <br>
<br>
And if I'm the Hugo Admin, we won't calculate or publish anything but the first place. Because, well, second is first of the losers.

Yeah, in that case, it's hilarity. Now, go back to when the the #5 nominee wasn't a Rabid Puppie. Did you want to tell that person they came in fifth?<br>
<br>
Every time? Every time they came in fifth, you wanted to be the person to say "You sucked so bad, that you barely beat out No Award?" Except, of course, in the cases when they didn't, when you get to say, "you sucked so bad you didn't even beat out No Award?" <br>
<br>
No. <br>
<br>
It's an honor to be nominated. Even when these bastards break it. You either get the rocket, or you don't. Working out how much you didn't get the rocket is just torment, and in the years where we follow the normal social conventions on nominations, I'm not willing to torment those who didn't get the rocket.<br>
<br>
Which is why I wouldn't publish the number for anything but first, and why I hate the idea of do so. Because if being nominated is such an honor, why is detailing how you lost so important?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6025523" target="_self">12:30 AM</a>  on April 28, 2015

<br>
Yeah, this is outright wrong; the issue is not that Beale has mainstream/orthodox acceptance and influence, it's that the Hugo's nominations system is ridiculously easy to game with a small number of people, and Beale and his band of nutjob asshole fans finally decided to exploit that.<br>
<br>
But it's also true - Beale <em>did</em> have sufficent clout to select 68% of the Hugo ballot. It's just that it didn't take much clout at all. <br>

It's possible that Sandifer meant that any other community would have just banned Beale from their WorldCon equivalent and awards, meetings...etc. But I think that's a bit of a stretch.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/112687" target="_self">His thoughts were red thoughts</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6025625" target="_self">3:06 AM</a>  on April 28, 2015

That's true, but he also had much of that clout with <i>people outside fandom</i>.  They really did suck in the GamerGaters, I wasn't just using it as a rhetorical cudgel.   You can't claim somebody has clout with fandom when the people that voted for him were in large part not members of organized fandom.<br>
<br>
I agree that what little support Beale has found resides mainly with the Baen crowd, I just don't necessarily associate that with <i>fandom</i>.

<br>
fuck. I just realized I'm going to be qualifying this for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
Beale is the <i>only</i> person to have been expelled from SFWA. In <a href="http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2012/11/poul-anderson-stanislaw-lem-philip-k-dick-and-me/">the case of Stanislaw Lem,</a> he had been granted an honorary membership. Some SFWAns got pissed at Lem and wanted his honorary membership withdrawn, then realized that it was already the case that SFWA's bylaws required it: Lem didn't qualify for an honorary membership because he qualified for regular membership. SFWA withdrew his honorary membership and then-president Frederik Pohl specifically pointed out that he was welcome to join as a regular member and offered to pay Lem's dues out of his own pocket. Lem decllined. <i>Lem was welcome as a member and declined.</i><br>
<br>
Beale was <i>expelled</i> under the "Expulsion of Member" clause of the bylaws.<br>
<br>
Lem deserves much better than to be grouped with Beale as an example of anything.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12683" target="_self">Zed</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6025865" target="_self">10:25 AM</a>  on April 28, 2015

<br>
I see a large gap between "Oh, the Hugos are just a popularity contest for SJWs" and "Fuck the Hugos, we're going to burn them down." Ringo is dismissive, which is fine in my book -- I'm dismissive of the Golden Globes, but I don't campaign to take advantage of them and then threaten to burn them down, nor do I "accidentally" find myself running a parallel campaign with someone who's doing those things either. I just don't watch them on TV (and make snide comments here on MetaFilter about them).<br>
<br>
Being in the same publishing house and sort of "hanging out" with those guys shouldn't tar Ringo, unless we can find more evidence of Puppydom.<br>

The answer is probably, "Beale is correct on points of law but doesn't want to pony up to sue, and no one else gives a fuck about the obscurities of Massachusetts law."

I think that's covered by "SFWA flouted the advice of their legal counsel and knowingly exposed themself to a suit." Given the rarity of expulsion, I can't imagine that they would have thought, <em>Yeah, fuck it, it'll just be too damn hard to do it the right way.</em> And given Beale's known truculence, I can't imagine they would have thought, <em>Nah, he won't bother, even though he's totally right and will be able to get any lawyer to take this on and get us to pay all of his legal fees.</em><br>

When the covers of professional trade magazines could have women in chainmail bikinis and nobody would (publicly) object. Their idol may actually not so much be Heinlein, as Niven, whose ex-wife evidently said "I'm not surprised he created a race where the females were non-senient."<br>

There has been a culture war going on in fandom between "the way things were", and modern thinking, with a lot of old behaviors no longer being acceptable. I don't think the puppies can really be blamed for starting the division of fandom into sides, they're just an outlyier that is forcing the old school fandom onto the offensive.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/83292" target="_self">happyroach</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6026368" target="_self">3:43 PM</a>  on April 28, 2015

<br>
"Don't bother to vote to nominate or award John Ringo. I won't actually publicly wipe my ass with it. I will simply turn down the nomination. I'd rather get a nomination from the National Socialist Worker's (Nazi) Party for running a particularly efficient Concentration Camp. That is, honestly, how I feel about the SF awards system."<br>
<br>
But in other comments has been firmly in the support the Puppies camp, if not their actions:<br>
<br>
"The SJW prats had already politicized the Hugos as a venue entirely for social agenda fiction (and furthermore their agenda.)"<br>
<br>
"A few years back, both the Hugo and Nebula committee started to give out small trinkets to all the nominees who didn't win. Runner up awards if you will ... I just realized that the Hugo committee is going to have to pass those out to Tom Kratman, Toni Weisskopf, Brad Torgersen, etcetera, EVEN IF THEY DON'T WIN A HUGO. Or I suppose they can eliminate the practice. But I really want to see their faces when they're forced to give one to Tom Kratman."<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/152174" target="_self">zakur</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6026380" target="_self">3:50 PM</a>  on April 28, 2015

<br>
They mailed one to VD last year. For the Hugos, it's a small silver pin shaped like the Hugo rocket, you get one for every nomination you've earned. They ask if you want it at the convention or if you want it mailed to you. <br>
<br>
So, giving one to Tom Kratman, whoever he is, will be trivial. Seriously, I just don't get why they think it's such a big deal who we hand these out to. We've been doing the pins forever, it's not new by any means -- at least the last 15 years. I know people who literally have over a dozen of them -- earned, mind you, not just because they were Hugo admins and had the box of them in thier house.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6026420" target="_self">4:14 PM</a>  on April 28, 2015

It wouldn't have surprised me to see this book marketed as a YA book, in many ways it very much has that feel to me (which I don't consider an insult incidentally, I'm a huge fan of good YA.)  It's kind of interesting to me that the fact that it was marketed to adults may have changed what awards it got nominated for.<br>
<br>
Right now, for me, it'd be a tough call between this one and Ancillary Sword.  Haven't read Three Body Problem yet, so we'll see if that changes things.

		<a name="6026666"></a><div class="comments">I've been thinking about it, and I think there are going to be roughly four types of voters at this year's Hugos:<br>
<br>
1) No-Award-Everything Voters.  Basically, people who say the Hugos are broken this year, call the whole thing a loss and resume when appropriate.  The prospect of people doing this has a whole bunch of commentators in a horrified tizzy.  I think that's an over-reaction, because I think a negligible number of people are actually going to do this.  I've seen tons of people agonizing about how this might happen, and almost no one saying they're actually planning on doing it.  I personally doubt this group will affect things much.<br>
<br>
2) Puppies.  Some people are worried that they're going to overrun the voting, but honestly, I don't see it.  They didn't get their nominations on the ballot with numbers, they got them on despite their lack of numbers.  17% of the nomination vote is the general estimate.  I don't expect that to swell too much in the final vote.  In fact, I suspect it will shrink.<br>
<br>
3) Slate-Nominations-Do-Not-Exist Voters.  (And variations thereof.)  Basically, people who will leave all nominations from slates off the ballot, except possibly for narrow specific categories, and will always include No Award as an option.  I'm one of these.  If they prevail, there will likely be No Awards in five categories and awards in twelve.  I expect there to be a fair number of these.<br>
<br>
4) Vote-As-Usual Voters.  These are the people who will go "well, the ballot is the ballot", and will only put something or someone below No Award if they feel it is of poor quality.  I also expect there to be a fair number of these.  If they prevail, there will probably be awards in all or almost all categories.<br>
<br>
It's hard to say exactly how it will play out without really knowing the numbers.  I think it will largely be a battle of Group 3 vs. Group 4; however, Group 4 would get a de facto boost from Group 2 in certain categories and Group 3 would get a de facto boost from Group 1 in certain categories.<br>
<br>
Groups 2+4 may end up having the majority, which would most likely mean the Puppy Slates would win in categories where they dominate completely but will win little else.  I don't think that's certain though.  A LOT of people are pissed off, and it could very well be enough to throw it to Groups 1+3, which would most likely mean no or almost Puppy Slate wins and several categories given No Award.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6026666" target="_self">7:14 PM</a>  on April 28, 2015

Bujold, along with the more Puppy-ish side of the ledger like Sarah Hoyt, Dave Freer and L. Correia) so much as the fans who tend to congregate around the Baen online forum, Baen's Bar, which tends to skew, so far as I know, pretty heavily Puppy-like. I buy Baen books pretty regularly, but have no real interest in joining the confab at the Bar.  Perhaps that just demonstrates my prejudice.

I would consider voting for <em>Annihilation</em> even over <em>Ancillary Sword</em> and <em>Goblin Emperor</em>.  I just finished book 2, and while it was a bit slower, it was a wonderful development of book 1, and I can't wait to read book 3. <br>
<br>
Basically, it reminds me of the greatest mad-science elements of Lost, which I enjoyed greatly. I really wanted the Dharma Initiative and the Numbers to have a satisfying science fiction explanation. No such luck.<br>
<br>
Southern Reach is reminiscent of that, but seems to have been very carefully plotted out, with quite a lot of depth and mystery.

<br>
I tend to point people towards the Crossroads trilogy, starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003G93ZEA/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/" data-amzn-asin="B003G93ZEA">Spirit Gate</a>.  It's epic, with wars and battles, duelling cultures, slaves and demons, and giant intelligent eagles of justice.  Also lots of people, both important and not, from a variety of backgrounds, all of them just trying to get along with their lives, and every one the hero of their own story.<br>
<br>
Her more recent series, the Spiritwalker series (starting with <i>Cold Fire</i>), sold quite well, but as it's a first-person pov of a young woman, I suspect many people assumed it was more of a YA series, and it seems to have been ignored by the critics.  It's not YA, and the universe is a post-colonial icepunk world in which dinosaurs evolved into lawyers and the Taino Empire is a serious threat to proto-Napoleon's takeover of the former Roman Empire (which lasted into the 1700s). It's pretty great.<br>
<br>
I really liked the <i>Jaran</i> series, which starts as an interstellar version of modern girl meets the Cossacks (and falls in love), but warps into something far more complicated almost immediately.  The second and third novels in that sequence are particularly good, in which an attempt at an interstellar rebellion is mirrored by an entirely-terrestrial campaign by horseback nomads against settled peoples.  <br>
<br>
She's probably best known for the Crown of Stars series, which is an 8-volume epic fantasy series from the 1990s, starting with <i>The King's Dragon</i>.  That's another series which ended up far more complicated and interesting than I expected, although I recall thinking the story got away from her a bit towards the end.  She's a better writer now, with a tighter handle on her structure &amp; themes.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027029" target="_self">11:17 PM</a>  on April 28, 2015

Yes, it was, and there's a very good chance it would have made the ballot this year if not for slate voting.  It still has a chance of getting the Nebula.<br>

According to predictions / prognostications that were made before all this went down, without slate voting the most likely books on the shortlist would have been Annihilation, Ancillary Sword, The Goblin Emperor, and The Three-Body Problem.   (With a fifth being more of a toss-up which could maybe have gone to any of Lock In, City of Stairs, Words of Radiance, The Mirror Empire, or a few longshots.)<br>
<br>
Predictions are never certain, of course, but given that they were on the ball for Ancillary Sword, The Goblin Emperor, and The Three-Body Problem, I would not be surprised if Annihilation turns out to be just one or two books off the edge of the current ballot.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027225" target="_self">5:10 AM</a>  on April 29, 2015

<br>
I started, just this month, with <cite>King’s Dragon</cite> (1997), finalist for the Nebula that year, first in an Epic Fantasy series of seven. I bought and read it because Elliott had been sensible on Twitter but expected to find the same sort of fantasy her fellow Australian female fantasy writers like Trudi Cavanan or K. J. Parker produced: fun, readable but lightweight. <br>
<br>
Instead what I got was a fantasy story set in what looked like the usual pseudomedieval world populated by modern people in fantasy drag, but what actually turned out to be a properly medieval world with characters who were everything but modern in their attitude to religion, slavery, honour, etc, a world in which men and women were much more equal than in the real Middle Ages, for the usual Epic Fantasy reasons, but where that equality still was embedded in a framework of morals and values alien to us. The usual Robert Jordan gloss about how magic is woman's work yadda yadda was here explored and  given depth and while there was a protagonist of a humble background getting himself a Destiny as a Chosen of the Goddess, for ninetynine percent of the novel he remains a humble, overlooked and even despised person. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile the other protagonist is the daughter of magicians who didn't inherit the powers of her mother and whom her father tried to protect from their enemies, who on his death is sold into slavery to the corrupt priester of the village they live in, who desires her for his mistress. And that isn't the subject of tittilation or just a challenge for her to overcome, but is one of the most chilling and realistic depictions of what domestic abuse looks from the inside I've ever read, certainly in fantasy. <br>
<br>
In a just world this should be as big as <cite>A Song of Ice and Fire</cite> because it is just as realistic and epic a fantasy as that one, though not so obviously GrimDark at first.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027553" target="_self">11:14 AM</a>  on April 29, 2015

This is fair, but second tier still means a Name in the SFF world, even if not a Big Name.  He had a solid career in writing both for books and television.

<br>
I'm still voting in categories with only one or two non-slate candidates, on the grounds that they got on fairly and shouldn't be punished for it.  They are still competing with No Award for my vote, so from my perspective it's not a matter of they-got-nominated-and-therefore-I-simply-give-it-to-them.  They can still lose if they're not up to snuff, so I consider them fair game to vote on.<br>
<br>
The Hugos don't exist in a vacuum, and I think it's perfectly fair for voters who have read SFF before to vote on the basis of "do I think this work is Hugo-worthy?" rather than in a direct comparison with other nominees.<br>
<br>
(Interestingly, it's theoretically always been possible under Hugo rules for there to be only one or two entries in a given category.  Although that fact isn't particularly affecting how I vote this year, I'd probably be doing the same thing - the-nominees-vs-No-Award on a subjective quality basis - if it did.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027606" target="_self">11:43 AM</a>  on April 29, 2015

<br>
Umm.<br>
<br>
*Every. Single. Member* of Loncon 3 was able to nominate at Sasquan. All 10K of them. My question is why didn't they? I mean, how inclusive is this -- the entire membership of the London, and the Spokane, and anybody who was a member of the KC Worldcon by January 31st of this year was eligible. <br>
<br>
And I fail to see how location puppy-proofs anything. The puppies don't care about attending, so the location doesn't matter. They got VD, Correia, Torgensen, and Olde Heuvelt on the ballot at Loncon by purchasing supporting memberships. They took over the ballot by doing the same. They'll try the same next year, and it does not matter where they are. You seem to be implying that US fandom actually intentionally voted that slate onto the ballot. If that's you're implication, short pier is there, take long walk, get mugged by an octopus on the way down. <br>
<br>
Arguably, if you want to puppy proof, <b>the</b> most important criteria is which site is going to attract the largest number of members, to increase the nomination pool. <br>
<br>
A DC Worldcon is going to be larger than Spokane, on the order of Montreal, so it'll be fairly large, say 4000 attending, 5500-6000 total, maybe more now that we're out of the Great Recession which depressed the 2008-2011 Worldcons totals.  Japan will be small, as it was last time, on the order of 3000 attending, but higher in supporting, also 5000.  Montreal will be about the same as DC.<br>
<br>
The kicker -- we simply do not know -- is Helsinki.  Helsinki runs a very, very large but very much not like a Worldcon convention every year, we have no idea how many of those folks would become members.  Helsinki is very, very popular in European fandom, but European worldcon fandom is much smaller than US Worldcon fandom. London, indeed, the whole UK, is a huge draw to the US Worldcon fandom, but Helsinki is a big unknown on that. The closest analog we have would be the Netherlands Worldcon in The Hague, but that was in 1990, long enough ago that I'm loathe to make any prediction about attendance, the fan base has changed a great deal in the last quarter century. <br>
<br>
So -- strictly in terms of puppy proofing, there is no evidence that Helsinki would hurt or help. So, on that ground alone -- <b> and this is a really flimsy reason to base a site selection vote on, so flimsy I would call it dumb</b> -- I would vote Helsinki 3rd, after DC and Montreal. <br>
<br>
There are far more important factors in site selection, the three big ones, indeed, the only three I think anybody should consider, are the concom, the facilities, and the city. The first is "Who is going to run this? Are they competent? What are they planning?" The second is "How far away is X going to be from Y? Where is my hotel room going to be? Where are the parties going to be? How are you going to handle X if it's not going to be the usual answer?" The last is tourism, but a lot of people take extra time off after/before, so tourist value is a real factor, and if the con is boring or a disaster and you're in a nice city, you have a fallback.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027609" target="_self">11:45 AM</a>  on April 29, 2015

I'm not, unless I can assure myself that the non-puppy work on the ballot is in my opinion the best work I've read in the year. In at least three cases it is not, so that category gets NA. Sorry for the poor SOB who made the ballot, but it's not the Best Non-Puppy Award. <br>
<br>
Yes, this makes them collateral damage, and that sucks, but it's no more harm that the ones who never made the ballot at all. Also, remember that we don't know the true scope. We don't know how many were nominated and quietly withdrew before the ballot was announced. This "I withdrew because of X" thing is unprecedented this year. <br>
<br>
And as to the singletons? I would be embarrassed if they accepted. Do you really want to be known as the person who only won a Hugo because you beat out the puppies? That alone, to me, is a solid reason to No Award, but I'm going full on mock if you act all Stanley Cup after beating four high school teams.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027649" target="_self">12:03 PM</a>  on April 29, 2015

That's a good point.  I'll think about that.  Possibly my standard should be "might I have voted this #1 in a regular year" rather than "would I have voted this above No Award in a regular year".<br>

Indeed, imagine this scenario: Nominees with ballots<br>
<br>
A: 300<br>
B: 20<br>
C: 3<br>
D: 3<br>
E: 3<br>
F: 3<br>
G: 3<br>
H: 3<br>
<br>
Who appears on the ballot? <br>
<br>
Answer: All of them. Last clause of 3.8.5 "except that the first three eligible nominees, including any ties, shall always be listed." First three would be A, B, and C, since D-H are ties, they appear too. <br>
<br>

		<a name="6027674"></a><div class="comments"><cite>And I fail to see how location puppy-proofs anything.</cite><br>
<br>
It doesn't puppy proof it, but having non-North-American cons does help make Worldcons more diverse, does help create new ties between fans in that region and tie them into worldwide fandom. Also, anecdotically, non-US/Canada Worldcons in the past twenty years have had more diverse and interesting shortlists than their NorthAm counterparts, especially those smaller Worldcons in the more conservative parts of the US. <br>
<br>
With regards as to whether why more LonCon3 members didn't vote in the Hugo nominations, I have the gut feeling that most people not heavily involved in Worldcon as such are more likely to vote in nominations for cons they go to, rather than for cons they've been to, even apart from some hiccups on the part of Sasquan, which hasn't been the most organised con to date. <br>
<br>
What I'd really like to see is whether my instinct that non-US Worldcons are harder to game for Puppies, based on the fact they tried and largely failed for LonCon and almost entirely succeeded for Sasquan is true, or whether they just tried harder this year. But I do think that in relatively virginal Worldcon areas there are more new people voting in nominations much less likely to vote in lockstep. <br>
<br>
And of course none of that is the fault of US fandom on the whole, but perhaps could lay some of the blame for the fact the Puppies were able to game the system the third time they tried it at the feet of a deliberately conservative and not very fast moving WSFS "fandom" who seem to think that if it didn't work in '66 there's no reason to try in 2015... <br>
<br>
We have had advanced warning after all, but trusted in the implied social contract to keep the damage limited and the idea that voting them below No Award would be enough to deter them from trying again. Had Worldcon as a whole acted after the first Puppy slate and changed the rules some way, any way to make this harder, we couldn't have prevented last year's attemp, but this year would've been stillborn. Now however they have at least two more years to fsck things up.  <br>
<br>
(And I blame myself a little bit here as well for not taking the Puppies seriously enough after they lost last year's Hugos.)<br>
<br>
You can't blame the voters or nominators for not standing up to those who game the system, you can't expect for people to keep chucking $40 down each year just to stop assholes when the WSFS as a whole is not able to change.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/141010" target="_self">MartinWisse</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6027674" target="_self">12:20 PM</a>  on April 29, 2015

		<a name="6027694"></a><div class="comments">After due consideration, though ... I think I may still vote any Non-Puppy above No Award if I would have voted them above No Award in a regular year.<br>
<br>
In a regular year, voting something above No Award is effectively making the statement, "Even if this is not my first choice, or even my fourth, I still think it deserves to win a Hugo."  If I don't believe that, I should rank it below No Award or leave it off the ballot altogether.  Otherwise, under Hugo rules, even if I rank it 5th, my vote could ultimately go to it, and my vote should only ever possibly go to stuff that could win a Hugo.<br>
<br>
So, if I wouldn't normally rank it below No Award, I am de facto saying it is something I believe to be Hugo-worthy.  If it could have effectively gotten a vote from me in a regular year, even if it wasn't my top pick, I think I should give it my vote this year, even if it wouldn't have been my top pick of everything I've ever read.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind this means I very well still might give a No Award in a few categories with non-puppy choices.  I'm pretty picky.

Ahh, yes. I should have put that in -- voting a local Worldcon is *always* an acceptable thing.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm leaning Helsinki, but really haven't put much thought into it because I'm really out of the convention circuit right now for the most part, with a couple of small exceptions, like the Eastercon, which I more go to to see UK friends than anything -- though working the newsletter this year was fun. <br>

I go to Midwestcon because, well, 'Doesn't go anywhere. Doesn't do much.' Anymore, that's really it.

Excerpt: <blockquote>As a moral and ethical matter, I do take to heart the adage, usually attributed to Buddha, but reasonable no matter who said it first, that hating someone is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. I don’t hate any of the Puppies; I have cause to personally dislike a couple of them, but even then I try not to get to that point of things, either. I posit that the large majority of them are or at least have the capacity to be, decent humans. I disagree with them on many points, and think their current course of action is stupid, wrong, detrimental and childish; I think many of them have behaved poorly, selfishly and in a way that highlights their own insecurities and personal issues; I think it’s sad they try to project those same insecurities and issues on others and use them to justify their own bad actions. </blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/16000" target="_self">Kattullus</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6028454" target="_self">5:34 PM</a>  on April 29, 2015

Science fiction is often politically influenced, in part because even when people are trying to write their books with the best of intentions, they are positing what could happen based on their knowledge of reality and how the world works, and their knowledge of reality and how the world works is influenced by their political beliefs. <br>
<br>
So, for example - I didn't think of the Honor Harrington series as message fiction, and I still don't - but I could see how it would appear as such to more economically liberal people. Indeed, one of the major plot points is how a Basic Living Stipend, or Dole, creates a failed society. Why I don't think of it as message fiction is that I don't think Weber wrote it in an attempt to get people to oppose basic living stipends. I think that he was just thinking of trends and extrapolating how they could apply to the future. But looking at it in that way requires me to think that it is at least somewhat plausible that a universal Basic Living Stipend<em> could</em> act on a society in that way - and that is a relatively economically conservative position. So to me, part of what I find wonderful about the series is, in fact, though I dont' generally think of it explicitly, political - I think he has some smart extrapolations about what could happen if a society did XYZ in a spacefaring age. <br>
<br>
When I read more explicitly leftist fiction, often I feel as though it is deliberate - as though the author is trying to convince me of the rightness and justice of the politics. But it may also be that they see their own vision as a natural extrapolation from how things are going, but I, coming from a different position, see it as contrived and unlikely. <br>
<br>
If this is the case, then without the slightest bad faith reading, it is easy to see how in many cases the Hugos - with a largely central-Democrat audience at the very least - are 'stacked' against conservative works - because central-Dems reading speculation from a conservative worldview are going to find it contrived and painful, even if they are trying to be scrupulously fair, and let's face it, many people from all sides aren't.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6028648" target="_self">7:48 PM</a>  on April 29, 2015

		<a name="6028658"></a><div class="comments">Well, "unfairly" is a weird term that is hard to quantatively judge. But that's part of what I'm saying up above, and why I included my own reaction to more 'lefty' fiction - because you look at things from your own bias of what is 'normal'. <br>
<br>
So, uh, let's take an example of something that is not a hotly debated controversy so as not to gore anyone's ox. Let's suppose that a certain percentage of our population have a firm belief that, oh, oh current technology is actually sentient and conspiring to kill us (we will call this the ToasterKiller population). Let us say another percentage of the population (The ToasterFriends) have a firm belief that is not the case and technology is solely helpful. <br>
<br>
If a ToasterFriend writes a book, it is likely not to contain any murderous toasters. The Toasterfriend doesn't think about the possibility of murderous toasters a lot. It's not a part of his daily experience, he doesn't think it's real, and he's not going to put it in a book he writes. A ToasterKiller writes a book, and naturally, she includes murderous toasters frequently and often, because it's a part of the world she sees. <br>
<br>
The ToasterFriend and ToasterKiller don't have to be writing to try to convince each other. In fact, Occam's Razor would suggest that they're not, absent any other evidence, because the natural effect of being a Toasterfriend or a Toasterkiller is that the world you see is the world you represent in fiction.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6028658" target="_self">8:01 PM</a>  on April 29, 2015

No, he's preaching to the choir, although possibly not understanding that a certain percentage of his readers has no idea what he's talking about.  <br>
<br>
I'm reminded, uncomfortably, of those John Norman Gor books, which periodically have multiple pages about how much women love to be raped.  I wonder if he thought he was going to convince anyone not already in agreement with that, or if he was just letting his mind wander about something that took up a lot of space in his brain? <br>

		<a name="6028994"></a><div class="comments">I've been revisiting the March 2005 posts in my livejournal where I snarked about the first two Honorverse books (I couldn't take more). The first one is about the holographic display of interstellar space in <i>On Basilisk Station</i>'s prologue that has directions like west and south, which was the moment when I realised that this was a very silly book. But it was while reading <i>The Honor of the Queen</i> that I had to share some snippets to my FL:
<blockquote><i>“I see,” she said, and wondered how the admiral tolerated such a nincompoop as his second in command. Houseman had a reputation as a brilliant economist and, given Grayson’s backward economy, sending him made sense, but he was also an ivory-tower intellectual who’d been plucked from a tenured position in Mannheim University’s College of Economics for government service. Mannheim wasn’t called “Socialist U” for nothing, and Houseman’s prominent family was a vocal supporter of the Liberal Party. </i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Houseman swelled with fury, and the corner of Honor’s mouth twitched as her own rage raced to meet his. After all his cultured contempt for the military, all his smug assumption of his own superior place in the scheme of things, all he could think of now was to order that same despised military to save his precious skin!</i></blockquote>

<br>
I pretty much agree with what you're saying here, corb.  I do, however, think there's a good deal more to unpack beyond that about what's been going on.<br>
<br>
The claims that the Puppies have been making include not just that the Hugos are biased towards works with left-leaning content, but also also that they are biased towards works by publicly left-leaning authors, biased towards works by visibly diverse authors (i.e., non-straight, non-male, non-white, non-cis, etc.), and biased towards works that are more literary in content.  And also that the converse is true and the Hugos are actively biased against right-leaning works, publicly right-leaning authors, etc.  They have also made claims that these things extend beyond the Hugos and are actually pervasive throughout the field of science fiction as a whole (e.g., Torgersen's complaint about book covers and book content.)  And beyond that, there is the issue of the actions they have chosen to undertake to address these claims.<br>

It's funny, but I never noticed all the bad clinton references.  After awhile, in long series like the Honorverse, all the subsidiary and tertiary characters get wrapped up in my head as various forms of redshirts and minor whitehats and blackhats.  That's particularly true when Weber will, as he is wont to do, spend 5 or 8 pages describing the actions and thought patterns of a sub character only to have them blown away by a sneak attack by one of the primary blackhats or whitehats.  <br>
<br>
So my default is just to see them all as redshirts and not pay attention to their names.  I suspect that says something bad about me.  But I'm not going to unpack it any further.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/221603" target="_self">my dog is named clem</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029106" target="_self">9:06 AM</a>  on April 30, 2015

		<a name="6029123"></a><div class="comments">Actually, this bend of the thread pertaining to the Weber books and their relation to the French Revolution reminds me of a point I'd meant to raise weeks ago.  And that's the extent to which some of the RP/SP rhetoric (I'm looking at <em>you,</em> JC Wright, among others) seems almost to recapitulate over 200 years later the work of Joseph de Maistre.  <br>
<br>
I'm afraid that I got stuck on him about 20 years ago after reading a marvelous and really depressing essay about de Maistre by Isaiah Berlin in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.  I haven't been able to track down a copy of that essay yet, although I hope to soon, but what I remember best was his descriptions of de Maistre's attitudes about aristocratic and Catholic hierarchies, and the justified use of force to keep those established hierarchies in place.  And maybe this is just projection, but I have this vague sense of de Maistre's absolute contempt for people who today might be described as SJWs.  The connection for me is the way some of the RP/SPs seem to view people who disagree with them as threats not just to SFF but to society as a whole.<br>
<br>
I'll admit this may be a bit far-fetched, but wanted to raise it as a possibility.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/221603" target="_self">my dog is named clem</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029123" target="_self">9:26 AM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<em>By the way, I prefer SJBs to CHORFs as a term. SJWs, social justice warriors, is not an insult as many articles have indicated. It’s the preferred term of the SJWs. </em><br>
<br>
That cheeses me right off! SJW blew up because GG took a niche label and made it apply to everyone who thought that yeah, maybe they had gone off the deep end. So yes, now it's the people's word, but it's not like the people asked for it or that they all want it applied to them. Y'all done screwed up by choosing a poor word, now chew on it.<br>
<br>
(Incidentally, my <em>impression</em> is that SJW was designed to be an ironic pejorative that criticizes the notion that slacktivism can make a difference. Since it seems clear that slacktivism does matter -at least in the court of public discourse, if not elsewhere- it seems like an object lesson in the danger of ironic insults.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029124" target="_self">9:32 AM</a>  on April 30, 2015

To clarify, I'm on page 336. My experience with Goblin Emperor isn't so much that of a world slowly coming into focus, but the realization that the complexities and nuance of Ethuveraz will never completely come into focus for me. That the confusion will never entirely clear, and that I'll spend the remaining 150 pages in a perpetual state of <em>wait, who's that person again.</em> <br>
<br>
That's actually one of the charms of the book, though. Because the emperor himself is muddling through as best he can, without the complexities and nuance of his empire coming into focus for him.

<br>
Yeah, I'm trying to unpack one piece at a time as I get through it, and I need to get back to my readings of the Hugo winners (<small>I got distracted by the Honorverse *cough* Books 1-5 *cough*</small>)<br>
<br>
My feelings as of the place I'm at in the reading, which may change later - not because I'm being shifty but just because I'm absorbing a LOT of new data and so my ideas are naturally influx - <br>
<br>
<em>works by publicly left-leaning authors</em><br>
<br>
Well, even<a href="http://www.metafilter.com/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6022550"> MartinWisse notes above</a> that <blockquote> Torgersen (or James "not the Top Gear bloke fortunately" May, who collected that list) is not entirely wrong when he says that people like Jim Hines or N.K. Jemisin have become prominent within SFF and fandom as much for their "activism" as for their writing; it's just that they think it's a bad thing.</blockquote>

And we've already heard it discussed by eriko and others that if the Hugos do have a problem, it's their habit of taking prominent people that have already won Hugos, or people that fandom likes overall, and voting for them. <br>
<br>
So at the moment, the only thing I disagree with on that score is that I think this probably also applies to right-leaning authors. <br>
<br>
<em>towards works by visibly diverse authors</em> <br>
<br>
There have been some pretty noteworthy campaigns to get people to read more books by visibly diverse authors. <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/50-books-by-people-of-color-my-reading-challenge-for-2014">50 Books POC</a>is the most prominent one that started small and snowballed, but I can recall a few others. There are even people here, in this thread, that have expressed that they try to make an effort to read more diverse authors. I don't think it's crazy to say that if someone is deliberately trying to focus more of their reading towards authors of color, that they are going to be more likely to nominate and vote for authors of color, because that's what they're reading. And I don't think it's much of a logical jump to think that people who really want more diverse representation in fiction and awards would choose to vote in accordance with their beliefs.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029295" target="_self">11:57 AM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
Both the Hugo and the Nebula are open nomination awards which are then voted by a fairly large body. The only difference is that the Hugo voting body is fan based (in particular, WSFS fandom) and the Nebula is pro based (in particular, members of SFWA.) They both have many of the same weaknesses. The Nebulas don't have quite the openness of the Hugos because of the qualifications needed to become a member of SFWA and thus be eligible, thus the RPs can't steamroll that ballot. The Nebulas, until recently, didn't have the social contract preventing logrolling that the Hugos did, and such was very common there.<br>
<br>
But, fundamentally, both the Hugo and Nebula start with a bunch of people -- and we're talking a pool of literally thousands of people -- with the right to write up to five choices per category on a slip of paper or a web form and have that tossed into the pile of nominations. Personal like and dislike, of course, is going to be a factor in any given person's nominations. How much of a factor depends on the person. There are people who will say "I fucking hate X, but damn, that's a brilliant book" and nominate it. There will be people who will say "I LOVE Y!!!!!" and nominate EVERY. SINGLE. PIECE. OF. DRECK. they write, which will be the 1 one nomination they get.  There will be people who say "I HATE X, FUCK THEM" and never nominated them, and there will be people who will say "Buddy, love you, but I ain't nominating that story, it just isn't that good." <br>
<br>
The hope is that with enough people, the biases will cancel out. Until 2013, they generally did.<br>
<br>
In science, we'd call this year a bad data set and discard it, but this isn't science. Thus, this thread. :-/<br>
<br>
Of what I consider the big three, the one award that's truly run differently is the Clarke. The Clarke is a juried award. Nominations are of two types. Accredited publishers may submit novels (only novels are considered) in the year they are published, and the jury may "call in" novels published that year as well. Three bodies provides jurors, BSFA, the British Science Fiction Association, The Science Fiction Foundation, a registered charity which supports the award, and a third group agreed by the first two, currently, Sci-Fi London, (The London International Festival of Science Fiction and Fantastic Flims,) which hosts the award ceremony. <br>
<br>
The judges form a six work shortlist, which they then reconsider and vote on, the winner of that wins the award, which includes the award itself and a cash prize equal to the year of the prize in UK pounds, which is *not* a trivial sum of money. <br>
<br>
Notably, Ann Leckie won the treble last year with <i>Ancillary Justice</i>, which is the first time that it's happened. Connie Willis came close with <i>Doomsday Book</i> which won the Hugo and Nebula and shortlisted for the Clarke, but Ann Leckie is the only one who hit all three.<br>
<br>
Heck, it's more common for Fandom, Prodom and the Clarke Jury to pick three different novels in a year than it is for them to pick the same one! We all thought *for sure* that <i>Blackout/All Clear</i>by Connie Willis was going to get a shot at the treble, but it didn't even make the shortlist for the Clarke. One of the reasons the treble is hard is that if the publisher doesn't submit the work in the year of it's UK publication, or a juror doesn't call that work in, then it can't make the shortlist -- so the much more restrictive nomination policy may well be leaving possible winners out. But with that aside, the Clarke is a fundamentally very different model compared to the very similar Hugo and Nebula models.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029372" target="_self">12:57 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
Sure. People who are reading a lot of X-type books are more likely to nominate X-type books because they take up more of their reading list. <br>
<br>
<em>And I don't think it's much of a logical jump to think that people who really want more diverse representation in fiction and awards would choose to vote in accordance with their beliefs.</em><br>
<br>
You're arguing that if people read books by diverse authors, not only are they more likely to nominate them because they are reading more, but they're more likely to nominate them than better books by white guys? Because this seems incredibly unlikely. (By better, I mean "books that the nominator themself feels to be better", not better on some objective standard of good books.)<br>
<br>
I can see that if you are debating which of two books to give the last slot to, you might choose that one based on 'let's have a more diverse ballot', but I don't believe that a massive number of people are just choosing any books written by people who aren't white guys and nominating them just because.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029413" target="_self">1:23 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
So I think it's important to note that I'm not talking about others here, or saying that they're bad people for doing this sort of thing. I do this, every single year, with voting. I do it not just in fan elections or board elections for member organizations but in real elections. I vote for the candidates who I know the positions of and like, but after that, in elections that I do not follow, I vote for the one with a female name. Some of this is because I trust an unknown woman to guard my interests better than an unknown man, but some of it is just because I want more women in government. I don't generally admit that, but it's true. This is how I vote, because of my ideology. Mind you, I try my damnedest to look at every candidate and see every position, but when I miss them, that's how I fill the blank spaces.<br>
<br>
So it's not hard for me to see fans, in Hugo or other elections, voting first for the books they've read and loved, but after that, doing the equivalent of my actions - for the books they have no clue about, choosing the ranking order by 'Who do I know? Who have I heard of? And are there any <strike>women</strike> [Insert Diversity Issue Here]?<br>
<br>
I don't think that fans are reading and loving books by white guys, but then turning away from their beloved books to nominate POC. I'm arguing that in cases where fans don't feel particularly strongly, they are more prone to be influenced by other considerations. (So, let's say you, of any political stripe, have only read 3 books that are FUCKING AMAZING. You're often still going to nominate 5. Who are those people? That depends on your biases.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029428" target="_self">1:35 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

Right, that's the Puppies' argument, after all: that nobody could honestly prefer the more diverse work by women/people of color, and that all those nominations and votes for <i>Ancillary Justice</i> were <i>solely</i> political.<br>
<br>
I doubt corb is making that argument, at least I hope not.  It's the Affirmative Action argument, that pushes for diversity inherently result in less quality, because only white men can produce things of quality.<br>
<br>
The Puppies may not admit that's the underlying rationale to their complaints about the last few years of award-winners, but it is.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/175133" target="_self">suelac</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029433" target="_self">1:39 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

		<a name="6029463"></a><div class="comments">I think there there's graceless political messaging on the left and the right. I dropped Chalker's River of the Dancing Gods because the protagonist introduces himself with one monologue about divorce law, and a few chapters later he launches another monologue about the complexities of US tax law.  There's also Doctorow's Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town which couldn't decide if it wanted to be a mythic urban fantasy about the son of a washing machine or a quixotic story about altruist vs. utility company. <br>
<br>
But I repeatedly go back to Le Guin's introduction to Left Hand of Darkness, which I'd name as a soft SFF manifesto. Creating the gender-netural/fluid Gethen wasn't done as a feminist political screed that we should become Gethen. It's a plot device, a thought-experiment to explore how North American humans construct gender. Both the Gethen and Leckie's Radchaai are explicitly dystopian cultures. Jemisin and Lucas both share a thesis that an evil empire backed by weapons of mass destruction is going to suck. I think Lucas gets more explicitly political in the prequels than Jemisin does in Inheritance.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/140936" target="_self">CBrachyrhynchos</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029463" target="_self">1:57 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
At the extreme one could probably make the argument that a voter confronted with two works that they consider to be of equal quality but one is by a minority &amp; the other is by a straight white guy, they'll choose the minority as a kind of affirmative action. But that kind of preference seems like it's wholly justifiable; it's your vote, so you get to break the tie however you want.<br>
<br>
Also, to give the puppies - or at least, the <em>sad</em> puppies - what I think is their due: looking over Torgersen's writing, his basis for argument is a belief there's a clear, bright line between taste and good writing.  The voters have been choosing Hugo winners that, in his mind, suit their taste for SJW preachiness but just aren't good writing. This is a convoluted garbage sausage of contradictions tied in five kinds of knots, but I do think that Torgerson somehow doesn't yet realize that he is waging a war on women.

<br>
Actually I think the key may lie in the link <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029376">rtha mentioned above</a>, which talks about something really important. <blockquote>I judge implicit political messaging according to different criteria. Simply put,<strong> I want it to meld into the background of the text, so it’s almost unnoticeable</strong>. But I also want it to pique my interest in the world presented, and I want it to reflect good choices—even when those choices are not consciously political.<br>
<br>
As general rule, I like it when the social fabric in my speculative fiction is just as speculative as the science, and just as imaginative as the magic in fantasy—provided everything is intuitive and internally consistent. It should feel “natural” and “realistic,” if not by any supposed “rules” of our world, then within the “rules” set out by the author, whatever those are.</blockquote>

This tends to agree with my own opinions - I dislike books when they jar me with something that seems unrealistic or 'crammed in'. I would wager that most people do, actually - reading is generally seen as somewhat escapist and immersion in the story is to be desired.<br>
<br>
But I think whether something seamlessly melds into the background of the story for you has a lot to do with your own political and other beliefs, and also probably how sensitive you are to the politics in question and how they're being raised - as well as, more importantly, where and how <em>you</em> were raised.<br>
<br>
What is 'natural' and 'realistic'? What does 'natural' and 'realistic' look like inside social justice circles? What does 'natural' and 'realistic' look like outside those circles? Urban individuals of all types look at various books and television and say, "Why are 95% of the people presented there white? Why are they so racist?" Rural individuals from more homogenous areas look at various television shows and say, "Why are there so many POC? What are they trying to Say?"<br>
<br>
I wouldn't have believed this, until I joined the military, and met guys who literally, before joining, had never met a single black or Jewish person before. They weren't what I would call racist - they didn't dislike POC - but they were just kind of weirdly confused by their prevalence, which I found mindbogglingly incomprehensible. Actually, at first I refused to believe them, how could you possibly have a town or high school without a single person of color? But I grew up in NYC.<br>
<br>
I think that kind of thing may be going on, for example, with trans characters or genderbending characters. I think meeting trans and genderbending individuals is quite common in cities and areas where it is safe to express those identities. I know a lot of people who are somewhere on the genderbend spectrum. I know people who seamlessly use neuter or counter pronouns. If I see some genderbending in a book or switched pronouns, it doesn't take me out of the story. But for some people who have never encountered that before, that may be startling and alarming, and thus reach the 'bad/preachy' bar for them.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/128858" target="_self">corb</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029565" target="_self">2:47 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
One of the big points that the sad puppies have been making is that many of the books they've nominated have queer characters and female characters - you can see them riff on it at mad genius club, according to hoyt, and on torgersen's blog itself. So I really don't think that the presence of queer characters or female characters is the trigger. (&amp; bear in mind that Correia believes that <em>Starship Troopers</em>, as is, unchanged, is a timeless and excellent work of science fiction that is presumably also not too preachy.) It really is just a mess.<br>
<br>
If I had to theorize, I'd say that the puppies know which authors they consider to be activists, and any shred of dialogue or speech that voices an ideology with which they disagree in a book by that author <em>must</em> be the author lecturing the reader. Thus, monologues sometimes read as hectoring, and sometimes as necessary character development. The puppies believe that for the authors they dislike the cigar is never a cigar, and for the authors they like it always is.<br>
<br>
But, again, this is giving them credit for being coherent, and they simply aren't.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/170113" target="_self">Going To Maine</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029594" target="_self">3:01 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

And I can't disagree more if he's convincing you not to use No Award at all. You may feel that you can vote some categories.

Because they will be owned by slates forever, and if that's the case, kill them dead. <br>

I cannot believe GRRM posted that, and I'm calling him out, and I never ever thought I'd have to do that. <br>

You don't have to No Award the whole slate. But if you're going to set aside No Award completely?

		<a name="6029732"></a><div class="comments">So, let's separate this into nominating and ranking. <br>
<br>
In ranking, I believe most people read the books and other works -- or at least try to read them -- and rank them by preference. It wouldn't surprise me if, given two books people felt equally about, they might rank by other things than quality, but I don't think it happens that often because it's not that often you feel exactly equal about two books. Of course, you might have an underlying bias to prefer books by women, and so on, but I think in general people do try to vote on actual quality. <br>
<br>
Let's say you are nominating and you have 2 spare slots. I figure -- because this has happened -- you ask other people what THEY thought was fabulous and use those to recommend. And probably you are sharing books with other people who share your interest in diverse speculative fiction, so they are also going to have a high proportion of diverse authors because it's what they read, also. I don't think people are just saying "here's this gay Chinese dude, let's nominate him because of who he is".<br>
<br>
Maybe you'll read 'The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere' because you want to read about a gay Chinese guy and his boyfriend and his parents (I can't remember why I first read it, presumably someone recommended it to me), but the reason so many people recommended it and nominated it and then voted for it isn't because of the politics, it's because it's a lovely story. (And you can argue about HOW speculative it is, but again, I read some of the JCW stuff so the RP slate didn't object based on things not being science fictiony enough.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029732" target="_self">4:35 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
Erm... which voting system are they using to tally? <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/the-voting-system/">This</a> suggests it's an instant runoff system. If they're using a ranked or instant runoff system it wouldn't ever cause a puppy to beat No Award if you rank it below No Award, but in a Borda count (for instance) it would. With Borda, though, you're usually obliged to rank everything.<br>
<br>
If the link there is right (and it's the Hugo's own description) then there's no way that ranking the puppies below No Award would help the puppies: the most it can do is determine which of the puppies wins, if the puppies were going to beat No Award anyway and you have a preference between them. (If you don't, fine; but in at least one case I do have a LEAST favorite puppy.)<br>

If you have a preference between them. Let's say you don't want a winner in Novella at all -- so you rank No Award first. But if there HAS to be a winner, you want it not to have been published by Castalia House, so you rank "Flow" second, then leave everyone else off. This will change the way Flow interacts with the other nominees, but not the way No Award ranks with any of them, because No Award will be given preference in the No Award Test over everything either ranked below it OR unranked.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/73072" target="_self">jeather</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6029862" target="_self">5:42 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
The thing about preferential vote systems is, the inclusion of otherwise-irrelevant candidates can affect the outcome even if they don't win. Let's say that you have three authors: Alice, Bob, and Cthulhu. You tally the votes; Cthulhu has the fewest first-preferences; those ballots get redistributed to the other candidates, and Bob wins.<br>
<br>
But let's add a fourth candidate - Dagon. Dagon's supporters are mostly people who would otherwise have put Bob first. Now when you tally the votes you find that Bob has the fewest first-preferences: Dagon split the vote! Bob is eliminated! His votes get redistributed, most of them go to Cthulhu and Dagon. Dagon is eliminated; most of Dagon's votes go to Cthulhu. Cthulhu wins! We all lose.<br>
<br>
So the question as to whether someone has successfully withdrawn their nomination is potentially very significant, and the fact that this is apparently unclear is actually a Big Problem.

The answer, now, is we don't know. The phrasing Sasquan used on the web ballot is incredibly unhelpful in determining that, and is frankly not the statement that the two people made. The ballot says that the two have asked that people not vote for them, which implies that they are still candidates, but both have clearly stated that they have withdrawn, which states that they are not candidates, but the implication is that Sasquan is going to treat them as candidates if anyone votes  them.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030084" target="_self">8:10 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
If you vote A #1, B #2, C #3, NA #4 and leave D and E off the ballot, it is as if you voted D and E as tied for last. D and E will *never* get a vote from you. No Award will if A, B, and C are eliminated. <br>
<br>
If A comes in 1st, B 2nd, and C 3rd, when they run the 4th place pass, they ignore votes for A, B and C. So your ballot will only have NA listed, so you will be voting No Award for 4th place, above both D and E. You don't need to list them to make that preference. You would be forgoing a vote in the 5th place ballot, unless D won 4th place, in which case, the only two candidates left for 5th would be E and NA, and you would vote, again, for NA. The one vote you do forgo is if it comes down to D or E, but as I said, by vote NA and then nothing, you're saying "tied for last", so you effectively split your vote between D and E. <br>
<br>
So, if you really want to vote against all but one, you vote (say) A #1, NA #2 and done. So let's watch that work. <br>
<br>
First pass. A wins YAY! Justice! A has placed, and A's author is going to have a great day at the con. Now, let's do 2nd place. You only have NA left, you vote NA for #2. But, it so happens C comes in with the majority, so C comes in 2nd place BOO!. On to the third place. A and C have placed and are out. You're 2nd preference is still NA, so that's your vote for 3rd place. Alas, D wins this once BOO!. D is 3rd. A, C and D are placed. 4th round. Again, your NA preference is still in the running, and still your top remaining preference. NA wins! NA comes in 4th. Now, B and E duke it out for 5th. Since you only voted A, then NA, your ballot is now out of the race -- you don't have B or E ranked, they're the only ones left on the ballot, so your treated as an abstain in the 5th place race. <br>
<br>
But note how you basically voted against *everybody* by not listing them, equally. However, you didn't vote for anybody any less than anyone else either. If you hated B less than D, you might be disappointed by this result. In which case, you should have ranked B after NA. <br>
<br>
But the risk of doing that is if NA is eliminated, that vote for B could be, if all your higher votes are eliminated as well, be the one that puts it over the top and wins them the statue, because it is a preference. You're saying "I want A, then I'd rather No Award, but if there must be an award, B." <br>
<br>
If you *in no way shape or form* want a work to get the award, do not EVER list it. Do your ballot as "I want A to win, if not, C, if not, then No Award" *and stop*, and there is no way that your ballot will directly help B, D or E win the Hugo. If you rank B, D and E afterwards, and NA, A and C are the first three eliminated from the ballot trying to get a majority, then you are now voting for B.  If you don't, then your ballot is put aside (for the moment) since it no longer has a preference. (It'll come back in a moment, though, for the No Award test. )<br>
<br>
So, that's the difference there. But if all you care about is That Piece Of Crap being beaten by No Award, you don't have to rank it, just make sure you *do* rank No Award, and that'll have the exact same effect.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030125" target="_self">8:31 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
This is where you've made an error. If No Award is eliminated, then someone is going to get the award: I'm not "putting it over the top" except in the sense that I'm putting it over the top of other puppy choices. <br>
<br>
Now look, I really don't care which John C. Wright novella wins if one of them is going to win: there, it makes sense for me not to rank any of them. But if a puppy is going to win short story editor, you can be damn sure I don't want it to be Vox Day, so ranking Resnick, Schmidt, and Brozek above Day is a must. What's more, as jeather points out, there's no way that my ranking those three could ever make them more likely to win than No Award so long as I rank them below No Award. In the same way, putting Day at the bottom of my Short Story Editor rankings wouldn't ever make him more likely to win than if I'd left him off. (I could leave him off for symbolic reasons.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36760" target="_self">anotherpanacea</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030245" target="_self">10:13 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
Race is A-E and NA. You've voted A, NA, B. I've Voted A, NA. Others vote in various ways. Nobody gets a majority in the first pass, so the one that receives the *least* votes is eliminated and those votes redistribute. Let's say that it is NA (because that's the usual case for the Hugos. Probably not this year, but it's usually the first one out.<br>
<br>
Your ballot is now effectivly A, B. Mine is A. Others change as well. The ones that had NA first redistribute to whomever they had next (if anything). If they didn't have any, they drop out, and a new total is set, which sets a new majority. If anybody has a majority now, they're the preliminary winner. Let's say they don't. Okay. Who's the least vote getter now? Let's say it's A.<br>
<br>
You're ballot now reads "B".  Mine reads "No Preference" and drops out. If B is now the majority, B wins, and you're vote helped it win. <br>
<br>
That's why if you absolutely positively do not want to directly help something win, you do not ever rank it, because if everything you rank above it is eliminated, you are now voting for it. EVEN if No Award was ranked above it. When it comes to the count, No Award is *just* another entry, and it can be eliminated just like any other entry. <br>
<br>
Note that there's no way to prevent *indirectly* helping it being elected. Note when your ballot dropped to B, mine dropped out. That reduced the total ballots by one, and possibly reduced the majority needed by one, which means that I might have allowed B to be elected simply by making his formerly just 1 vote shy now just good enough. But the nature of the beast is that it's impossible for me to account for all the possibilities, and I'll risk the indirect harm to avoid the direct.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030299" target="_self">11:13 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

		<a name="6030335"></a><div class="comments"><i> Is there any talk of changing the process to get rid of the possibility of ranking competitors below No Award? </i><br>
<br>
No. <br>
<br>
1) Some people care that, in the final tally, VD comes below No Award. I think this is dumb, others don't. <br>
<br>
2) Some people care about votes like "I want A, if not, C, if not, No Award, but if you must D, then E, but not B." Ranking after No Award is the only way to express that preference, and given that in normal years No Award doesn't win, this is not a dumb thing at all. <br>
<br>
I stand by the simple method of voting -- select those that you thinks are worthy. Rank them. Rank No Awards next. STOP -- when explaining the system, esp. to people new to STV.  The caveat here, though, is all I care about is selecting the Hugo Winner or No Award. I don't care about 2nd through last place at all, and I don't care which non-worthy work wins if the worthy works and No Award do not. I think most people should go into the election with the same posits, because it makes the ballot so much simple to understand and work. <br>
<br>
Those who care about those things would want to then rank the stuff below No Award, but that can have the oddball side effect of helping something they ranked *below* No Award win, which is odd when you think "but I said No Award?!"<br>
<br>
This, alas, is one of the many reasons Voting Systems Are Hard, and if you want to get into Yet Another Endless Discussion between Condorcet and STV, I'm happy to point you to one -- there's usually one going on the Internet -- but I'm not doing that here because the answer is the same. There's no answer. Condorcet is the clearly superior method, except for the nasty problem of when you hit a paradox (A prefers B, B prefers C, blah blah EVERYBODY *and* NOBODY GETS A HUGO!) and the ways of resolving that are pretty damn crappy. STV has lots of warts, esp. with No Award, but it either very clearly finds a winner or very clearly ties and shows you that, and you know the answer at the end of the count. <br>
<br>
So, you can take perfect when it works, or ugly but always works. We took ugly. Other groups took perfect. If you can switch to another voting scheme if you hit a circular paradox, Condorcet is a really good scheme to start with, but we can't afford to suddenly run a snap Hugo election. P<br>
<br>
And, yes, people have honestly suggested that everyone just cast two Hugo ballots, one Condorcet, and if that can't resolve, one STV to resolve the election. You know, because explaining how to vote the Hugos isn't hard enough now!<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030335" target="_self">11:43 PM</a>  on April 30, 2015

<br>
Yes, both would count against it in the NA test -- you explicitly ranked NA above B, I ranked NA and didn't rank B, which means I count towards NA in the NA test. However, there are other votes out there in that example, since I just called them 'other votes' I can't tally them. Normally, the NA test is a formality, and I'll assume that since B in fact won, that enough will have B over NA to beat our two NA over B. However, this year? <br>

		<a name="6030389"></a><div class="comments">ericko, you are advocating a kind of strategic voting that is unnecessary to achieve your stated goal; what's more, you are advocating it in a way that suggests that failure to adopt this unnecessary strategy will lead to unintended (bad) outcomes. But that's false: it is safe to make rankings below No Award without jeopardizing No Award.<br>
<br>
Part of the problem is that you're making it more complicated than it needs to be: we don't need to do full Condorcet testing to develop our own voting strategies here; we just need to test simple pairwise counterfactuals.<br>
<br>
<em> If B is now the majority, B wins, and you're vote helped it win. </em><br>
<br>
This is an odd definition of "help." B had the majority, so it won with or without my vote. Think of the counterfactual: if I hadn't ranked B, would B be worse off? It would still have the majority of the remaining votes, unless it was tied with D, which (since I ranked it below B) I also didn't like.<br>
<br>
In that case, my vote didn't help the pair B&amp;D: all my vote did was make sure that B won and not D, given that No Award was no longer possible. No Award already lost, so somebody from the pair B&amp;D was going to get the award, and if you have any preferences about how that should go, then you need to address it. <br>
<br>
What's more, you can safely address preferred defeats <strong>without making your higher ranked choices worse off</strong>. There is no sense in which this could inadvertently hand a victory to a puppy that a puppy wasn't already (without my vote) going to win: this merely lets me choose between puppies in that worst case.<br>
<br>
An example: look at the slate for best related work: <br>

<br>
I don't want any of these to win, so my first choice would be No Award. But I especially don't want Wright or Williamson to win. Now: I know that at least some voters want Wright and some would like Williamson. So I'm going to rank everyone above these two but below No Award.<br>

<br>
And eriko was slightly wrong, the ballots are going to close end-of-day July 31st, not end-of-day July 1st. I'd *love* to say that was a typo, but nope, I honestly thought it was the 1st.<br>
<br>
(History digression!)<br>
<br>
And in the old paper days, that was a reasonable day for it to close. We had to wait for mail to get through (and some of that was overseas mail -- and we had to stress AIRMAIL, PEOPLE!) and then we had to shuffle all those ballots by hand, or type them all into a computer and run the numbers. Really, I still though moving the stacks was fasters, I could do three counts by hand faster than typing them in. It wasn't until we got networked computers (so that you could have multiple people typing in ballots) that computers became notably faster for the vote count. <br>
<br>
2000 was the year it really changed when myself and Chaz Boston Baden (as the Web Team) and Saul Jaffee (as the Hugo Admin) first put the Hugo Ballot online. I wrote a routine that fired the ballots to him as a formatted CSV that he could import straight into the count program, and it would automatically handle the new version rule<sup>*</sup> if someone voted twice. It went very smoothly, much to the chagrin of everyone who predicted utter disaster, and to everyone who predicted that the Hugos would be hacked. <br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I was watching, Saul was watching, a couple of other really good sysadmins were watching, and we all had other good sysadmins and netadmins on speed dial. <br>
<br>
It worked. It set the standard. It made people run to the business meeting and pass a rule mandating paper ballots. :-) (I voted for that, actually, I like a fallback plan, but I took it as a compliment.) <br>
<br>
The funny thing about Chicago and this is the guy who's written the current Hugo software lives about three blocks from me.<br>
<br>
Yep. For the last 15 years, you guys have counted on people from Chicago to count the votes.<br>
<br>
Heh. Heh. Heh. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Saul and I wrote the rules because, well, somebody had to and Tom Veal, the Chicon 2000 chair, said, "write the rules." We decreed that 1) Paper would trump, because if you bothered to send in the paper, then we'd take that over the online -- plus, if we had a critical problem, we could push the mail in back, tell everyone to mail in, and we already had a policy that let us override your online with the paper ballot 2) If you sent in two ballots, the newer would trump. We'd assume you'd read more.  With paper, the rule had gone back and forth from "first", to "last", to "call and ask" but we said "last paper, then last electronic." From what I can tell, that's the now firm rule to this day, but I haven't asked. Certainly, "last electronic" is the current rule, you can change your vote right up to the deadline. <br>
<br>
Chaz and I also tried for Site Selection online, but that was much more complicated, because we had to get all the bids to agree on everything, and the rules there aren't nearly as established. This is one reason that you still see the "send in the PDF" stuff, because often bids want to see the registration forms, which are the top half of the site selection ballots. Fixing this really means fixing the mindset on how we do the Site Selection handoff, but that fight is one of the reasons I stepped away from this game for a long while.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030564" target="_self">10:06 AM</a>  on May 1, 2015

My guess is that's the nagging addressed in the "edited to add" section in the body of the post and covered by the caveat that your ranked preferences do count for helping anything you've ranked knock out anything you haven't. So if you rank things below No Award, don't omit rankings for things you simply have no opinion on. For this ballot, I doubt that's a problem.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/93769" target="_self">Monsieur Caution</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6030667" target="_self">11:08 AM</a>  on May 1, 2015

<br>
It does if the last two candidates are in a dead heat: in that case, they both win an award. In my example, refusing to rank Wright over Williamson could lead to them <em>both winning</em>. So in that very rare event, I'd actually be worse off by not ranking at least one of them.<br>
<br>
More generally, it looks like <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/the-voting-system/">you're ignoring the No Award Test.</a> A ballot that places No Award higher than some prospective winner will only cause that winner to win if more people placed that prospective winner above No Award than below.

<br>
Let me sum this up as "I'm not." I've been on the Hugo subcomm, I've been working with this voting system for a quarter century. I know this system, I know more edge cases than I care to worry about, I am <b>deliberately</b> not bringing them up here, because fundamentally, they're really noise<sup>*</sup>, and the No Award test is not the edge case here. <br>
<br>
The No Award test triggers extremely rarely -- it basically comes up only when you're dealing with things like five very polarizing candidates, and it's there because the fundamental point is that we want at least 50% of the voters to go "I'm OK with that winning" and there are conceivable sets of nominees that could achieve a majority after several rounds that, in fact, more than 50% would in fact not be happy with winning. <br>
<br>
It's *extremely* rare and I seriously doubt we'll see it even this year -- although if the puppies vote ABCD-NA and Fandom votes a combination of E-NA and straight NA, it's certainly possible. But I suspect the NAs this year will be straight NAs -- and there's no No Award test if No Award wins, obviously. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Some 75% of them can only happen if 2X or less people vote, where X is the number of candidates.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6031293" target="_self">3:59 PM</a>  on May 1, 2015

But -- given the assumption that there will be on the order of a few thousand voters, not a bad assumption -- I was playing around with numbers and couldn't come up with an edge case where listing things after NA would help them compared to NA and stuff listed before NA.

<br>
1) We're reading this *after* a lot of discussion of slates and slate voting, and now everybody knows what a Hugo "slate" means and why they object to it (if they do), which wasn't so much the cast a few months ago even if you knew what happened last year;<br>
<br>
2) Torgersen was involved with the Sad Puppies last year but I'm pretty sure he wasn't running it, Correia was, and if you hadn't been following along you wouldn't know that had changed, and;<br>
<br>
3) Wade and Torgersen were on friendly terms, e.g., "We then discussed his upcoming work duties (army reserve stuff)."<br>
<br>
So, a friend contacts her and asks if he can put her on "my Hugo recommendation slate" without mentioning Sad Puppies, which she knew he was involved in but probably doesn't think he's running, and there hasn't been a lot of discussion of "slates" yet so it's pretty easy to miss, so her thinking, "Oh, my friend is personally recommending some authors he likes on his personal blog, how nice" doesn't seem too utterly bizarre to me.<br>
<br>
Also ... I'm not sure what the issue would be here?  She withdrew months ago, so quickly that hardly anyone even noticed it.  Mike Glyer only knew about it and contacted her because Brad Torgersen had mentioned she'd been on and withdrew in a comment on Glyer's blog.  She said nothing publicly until directly asked, and when she was she was circumspect enough in what she said that Brad Torgersen still assumed she was on the side of the Puppies until she had to ask him to stop speaking for her.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033159" target="_self">4:49 PM</a>  on May 3, 2015

My maintenance of our friendship was out of courtesy. I guess I was too idealistic, thinking that Sad Puppies might be over and that you would just be talking to me about some Hugo recommendations, but I do like to think the best of people. It should not be my responsibility to go and look up whether a person is being dishonest every time they say they like my work.</blockquote>Remember that Larry Correia had been the Chief Sad Puppy in years past -- if Wade hadn't been following Correia, Torgersen, or the Puppies campaign, it's not unreasonable for her to think that his "Hugo nomination slate" might not have been the Puppies. Also, Sad Puppies 1 and 2 weren't about <em>sweeping</em> the nominations -- they were just a couple of things in various categories that Correia et al thought were unfairly ignored by the Hugo voters. It wasn't until this year that they decided to try to <em>ex</em>clude things they didn't approve of.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/85249" target="_self">Etrigan</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033161" target="_self">4:50 PM</a>  on May 3, 2015

<blockquote>

I seriously need some helpful soul, or maybe some kind of crowd-sourced thing that can tell me what I should be reading as things come out so I’m not floundering under drifts of pages on book mountain when the Hugo nomination period opens. Preferably some recommendation engine... I don’t want reviews, I don’t even want opinions, I just want a simple list or titles and authors and maybe a helpful link where someone can say hey, I think this book should totally get a Hugo, and then other people who agree can maybe give it a plus one, and that’s it.</blockquote>

As far as technical solutions go, I think it has promise. I've seen some other suggestions that would need a lot of moderation to avoid getting swamped by trolls, but maybe a system with only books and likes could resist the worst of trolling. (With some protection from flooding the votes.)<br>
<br>
But I keep thinking that maybe the solution is cultural, not technical. What if fandom was more willing to talk about Hugo nominees throughout the year, not just in February? Take John Scalzi, just as an example. He has annual open threads for his readers to suggest works. This year, <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/02/12/the-2015-sff-fans-award-recommendation-thread/">it ran on Feb 12</a>, a month before nominations were due. If a similar open thread also ran in, say, September then there would be more time to actually read the recommendations.<br>
<br>
People already talk about stuff they like all year long, of course. But Hugo nomination season seems to open the floodgates: More recommendations from more voices. Can we give ourselves permission to talk up our favourite works earlier, when there's more of a chance to read them?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/205463" target="_self">Banknote of the year</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033237" target="_self">7:03 PM</a>  on May 3, 2015

And one of the premises the whole Werewolf* campaign is that the Hugos had been taken over by "not-really-fan" voters, that is, those not worthy to vote.<br>
<br>
Torgerson would seem to have now proven himself to be "another ego only worth ignoring", except that apparently doing so allows people like him to try to sneak in and steal all the good stuff for themselves, as they're doing to the Hugos. And if you need any further proof that Scalzi is not ego-driven, there's his regular feature on his blog where he lets other authors talk about their latest books and the <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/category/big-idea/">Big Ideas</a> behind them. I've noticed none of the notable Werewolves* have been featured there in recent memory, and it can't be because he's rejected them or they'd REALLY let everybody know, but I think they generally realize they have no actual Ideas, Big or Small, just perpetually rehashed political talking points. <br>

Relatedly, I expect that we are seeing the beginning of the year-long Hugo campaign, if there is to be one, with major bloggers and reviewers producing slates of their own.<br>
<br>
The puppies won't go away but slate voting in the nomination phase will become an accepted practice and their influence will become negligible.<br>
<br>
Somewhere up above someone mentioned that it would be nice if we talked like this more often, evaluating the work and making recommendations more than just for one month a year. Well, I think that's where we 're headed: there will be an io9 slate and a Wired slate and probably a GRRM slate and a Scalzi slate.<br>
<br>
There will be a ton of overlap between the puppies and non-puppies. Slates will become parties. The publishers will try to game their way onto as many as possible.<br>
<br>
This thread proves that a lot of people care. So the likely outcome is that the people who make sci fi will try to give us more of what we want. And that's not a bad thing, or at least it's not as bad as it seems right now.<br>

<br>
Disagree. Torgensen and VD are all in, of course, but the  slate itself is collapsing. We've got people running away from at fast as they can. And when the result of being on that slate is going to be Never Ever Ever Winning A Hugo, Period -- because that's what's happened, every one still on the RP slate has basically ensure they will never ever win a Hugo, ever -- the next person with a slate is going to be told GET ME OFF THAT GODDAMN SLATE, ASSHOLE. <br>
<br>
If anything, this might in fact fix the slate problem by simply making it "Do you want to be those assholes?" <br>

<br>
Their slate is collapsing, true. But they'll do it again anyway. And the rest of us will have to decide whether to accept their nominations or collaborate to oppose their efforts.<br>
<br>
It'll come down to this: either vote for a slate or accept another year of No Awards and similar nonsense. I already outsource a lot of my reading selections to io9 every year: it's not like my Hugo nominees aren't already dominated by the things they told me to read. So it's a small step to a slate.<br>

I'm not offering to organize it. I'm just predicting it will exist. GRRM is already basically doing this with his award by award analysis of worthy entrants.

Yeah. And all this year's troll members can vote again, so they'll be a pretty powerful force if they want to be.<br>

This is obviously false. It's notable that the puppies did have some standard picks in their slates. It's probably not fair to say that the puppies' movie and television choices should be shut out forever more (we're really going to hold it against Nolan and Gunn that the puppies like them?). GRRM himself was a puppy pick, at least in the sense of “The Mountain and the Viper” being on the rabid list! But no one is going to shut him out for that.<br>
<br>
Even if it comes in a kind of half-hearted form, there will be slate voting from now on, on both sides of the "puppy" divide and hopefully on lots of other sides as well: a military sf slate, a bunch of different social justice slates, etc.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36760" target="_self">anotherpanacea</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033616" target="_self">9:41 AM</a>  on May 4, 2015

Probably not serious, but it's shockingly immature and quite disingenuous coming from someone who's been boasting about how the SP3 slate includes folks of all different sexual orientations.</em><br>
<br>
Scalzi follows up here, with a comment noting Brad's weird semi-apology:
<blockquote>[T]he apology is for insinuating about my sexuality, but apparently not for suggesting that there is anything at all wrong with being gay. Which is to say Torgersen appears to be apologizing for the not offensive thing (insinuating regarding my sexuality), and not about the <em>actual</em> offensive thing: The homophobia that asserts that being gay is such a shameful thing that implying that I am so is an insult that rates an apology. Allowing that “even Scalzi” doesn’t deserve to be called gay does appear to apply that to Torgersen, <em>being</em> gay is a real problem. There’s a lot left unexamined, here.<br>
<br>
[...]I think it’s interesting that when Torgersen thought to apologize, he thought to apologize first <em>not</em> to the person to whom he had directed his intended insult, but to the people to whom he offered the insult as snark, at least one of whom felt more than happy to continue the attempted insult (by offering up a picture of Wil Wheaton as my “wife,” because <em>hur hur</em> me and Wil are totally gay together). Apology by way of dependent clause is a curious way to go.<br>
<br>
I accept Torgersen’s apology for attempting to belittle me, even if I was not in the least bit belittled; in this case it was not the specific insult, but rather that the insult was attempted at all. I do think Torgersen’s apology should be more properly offered to people who are gay, whose existence, and the fact of who they love, apparently so discomfits Torgersen that he uses who <em>they</em> are as a way to suggest that<em> I</em> am someone less than worthy of respect as a human being. I’m not gay, but if I were, I would be absolutely proud to be so, and Torgersen would still have no excuse for thinking of me as something less than equal for it.<br>
<br>
It’s my wish that, in return for accepting his apology, Torgersen might take some time to examine what in his own thinking caused him to offer his attempt at an insult. I’m not asking it as a requirement for accepting the apology; it’s just a hope. As I said before, the Sad Puppies seem to be carrying around a lot of fear and anger, Torgersen no less than any of the rest of them. Some time looking inward, and possibly examining the roots of that fear and anger, might do him some good.</blockquote>

It's almost as if the puppies whining about how open-minded they were being by checking off "diversity" boxes was nothing more than a facade for them being bigoted assholes! I mean, I came to that conclusion a long time ago, but at this point it seems like either they just don't care, or their anger is making the masks slip off.

<br>
Sorry, gonna go with option B.  I am going to nominate whatever I feel like next year.  I will happily take reading suggestions, but will ignore any call to rally behind any specific works.<br>
<br>
There are elections where I'm willing to vote strategically, because the potential results are too important to too many people to risk catastrophic failure.  This is ... not that.  It's personally important to me in several ways, but frankly, the Hugo winners do not choose who is on the Supreme Court or anything like it.<br>
<br>
So, if ignoring slates means another year or two of nonsense and No Awards while the Hugo gets its house and rules in order, so be it.  It might go down that way.  But the Hugos have been around for decades, and can survive a year or two of idiocy.  I personally find that preferable to nominating any work I wouldn't normally have nominated.<br>
<br>
And it might not even come to that.  If there are dozens of slates next year, they might lose all power and meaning.  But if it does come to that, I'll just ignore the Hugo, the same way I ignore a bunch of other awards, for as long as I need to.<br>
<br>
I am, however, going to nominate next year, in every single damn category.  I will scour the earth until I find five works, people, or organizations worth putting on the ballot in every single one.  If the Puppies beat my nominations because I stuck to my principles, that's OK with me, but I'll be damned if they do it because I was too lazy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/17938" target="_self">kyrademon</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033626" target="_self">9:47 AM</a>  on May 4, 2015

<br>
Katherine Addison, <i>The Goblin Emperor</i>; Robert Jackson Bennett, <i>City of Stairs</i> (which I've purchased, so this thread produces another nickel in Bennett's pocket); Liu Cixin, <i>The Three Body Problem</i>; William Gibson, <i>The Peripherial</i>; Jacqueline Koyanagi, <i>Ascension</i>; Anne Leckie, <i>Ancillary Justice</i>; Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach trilogy, notably <i>Annihilation</i>; Ben Winters, <i>World of Trouble</i><br>
<br>
(I wouldn't rank it as better than what I've read from the above list as the best genre book published in 2014 -- nor is it the best book in the series -- but I also enjoyed Max Gladstone's <i>Full Fathom Five</i>, which was mentioned in passing.)<br>

You have no idea how long fannish memory is. Those that withdrew, tried to get off the slate, didn't accept the nomination are all forgiven, but those who didn't? They are going to have a *long* road ahead of them to ever get a rocket. Any time they get a nomination, even if it's for a worthy work, the word "puppy" will go out and then the words "oh, hell no" will be uttered and if they're lucky, they'll be ranked above No Award, but I doubt it. <br>
<br>
They basically said "Fuck you" to Fandom, and Fandom is *legendary* about remembering things like this. We are still talking about the Exclusion Acts and the Breendoggle. If Worldcon fandom exists 75 years from now, they'll be talking about this. Somebody alive today will be a Worldcon FGoH, and they'll be asked questions about *this very thing* because they were there.<br>
<br>
There are orgs in Fandom dedicated to preserving history. All of this will be saved. I fully expect this entire thread to end up in FANAC's archives, to be honest -- if they can get permission from everyone to do so. Hmm, that gives me an idea.<br>
<br>
(FANAC -- you have permission to save my posts on this thread. Note this extends solely to my posts. Note that you do not need permission to point to this site, but you almost certainly do need permission to copy this thread elsewhere, and you have *for my posts only*, because I cannot grant that permission any further than for myself.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033672" target="_self">10:27 AM</a>  on May 4, 2015

<br>
And this work stands why I and several other fought against the Best Non-English or Best Translated Hugo. Amongst other objections, we don't want to make Best Hugo be Best Hugo that isn't X, Y or X. <br>
<br>
<i>The Three Body Problem</i>, is, by all accounts, a really good work. Why does it need to compete in a separate category? Answer: It doesn't. It should fight in the big ring with the others, and I'm glad it is. I'm just sad it's not fighting against four other worthies. <br>
<br>
Aside: This is also one of many reasons why I'm against a Best YA Novel -- because I don't want Best Novel to be Best Novel that isn't YA, and I have yet to have *anybody* give me a definition of a YA novel that I can have a randomly selected Hugo Administrator<sup>*</sup> administer properly. Novel/Novella/Novelette/Short Story involves number of words, BDP-L/BDP-S involves running time. Hard numbers you can split on. <br>
<br>
One of the meta-rules of the Hugos is that a given work is eligible for One and Only One award, so if you construct a Best Translated or Best YA or Best Work Featuring Cats Hugo, you remove that work from some other Category. There's no multi-category awards, the way you win multiple awards is have multiple works nominated. <br>
<br>
Best Translated was really hard, because I actually love the idea of giving the *translator* an award, because translation of fiction is really really hard. But the problem is we'd be award for translation *to English* and the work would be eligible itself that year because that would be the year it was first published.<br>
<br>
The other problem is currently, there aren't enough translated works per year to fill a category. Right now, the very few that make it tend to be excellent works, but this is selection bias, only the very best sellers tend break through to foreign markets, so you tend not to see mediocre works translated, with the possible exception of English works translated elsewhere, simply because SF/F is currently an English dominated field. <br>
<br>
And how do you judge the translation, unless you can read the original work and the translated work? We're really not the right group to judge this. So, yeah, best to let that one go by the board. <br>
<br>
* This is a polite way of saying "a complete idiot," by the way.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033698" target="_self">10:43 AM</a>  on May 4, 2015

<br>
Yeah, we're going to long remember the treachery of Christopher Nolan and James Gunn, I'm sure. Game of Thrones will NEVER WIN ANYTHING EVER AGAIN. <br>
<br>
It seems much more likely that the focus will be where it ought to be, on Torgenson, Day, Wright, and a few other people who would never have been in the running without the puppies and are unlikely to produce award-worthy work in the future. Will this hurt Wright's chances? Does anyone honestly imagine he'd have a chance to begin with? You can't go below zero probability.<br>
<br>
Jim Butcher is the only puppy nominee who might have stood a chance some day in the future (possibly for a television tie-in or some such) and I think it's an open question whether fans will hold his presence on the slate against him if he is a real contender otherwise.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36760" target="_self">anotherpanacea</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033699" target="_self">10:45 AM</a>  on May 4, 2015

The following series were also named in the "search for nominees for the nonexistent Hugo series award" (e.g., these series were put forward as possibilities for a nomination if there existed an award for ongoing or completed series with a book published in 2014; these may vary in quality more than the previous lists as an attempt was being made to find any decent qualifying 2014 book):<br>

<br>
There are a small number of people who freak out whenever GRRM writes anything that isn't GoT. <br>
<br>
You will also note that they are <b>not</b> currently laying into him for writing those massive missives about this whole situation. They recognize that this is something completely different.<br>
<br>
And, I'll be honest. I expect he won't win for GoT novel again unless he finishes and finishes well -- in which case, he may well get an award for the entire series, much like <i>Wheel of Time</i> did, but I suspect part of that reason is a lot of people were very fond of Jim Rigney, myself included.<br>
<br>
<i>Jim Butcher is the only puppy nominee who might have stood a chance some day in the future</i><br>
<br>
He's done something very interesting, which is...nothing at all, as far as I can tell. Which is probably the best thing possible.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12684" target="_self">eriko</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6033749" target="_self">11:10 AM</a>  on May 4, 2015

		<a name="6034137"></a><div class="comments">Uh, and also the final novel in Mary Robinette Kowal's Glamourist stories, <em>Of Noble Family</em>. The series is Jane Austen in a world with mostly decorative magic, and while the first book is very much a rehash of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, later books have more active plots with spying on the French invading armies or conducting a heist in Venice.  Verrrry recommended if you're in for comfort reading and low stakes action for a change.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/181391" target="_self">sukeban</a> at <a href="/148587/2015-Hugo-Nominees-Announced#6034137" target="_self">2:14 PM</a>  on May 4, 2015

Kate Elliott's <i>Court of Fives</i> (YA fantasy) and <i>Black Wolves</i>.<br>
Fran Wilde's <i>Updraft</i> (which has a ridiculously beautiful cover).<br>
The new Naomi Novik.<br>

I'm also not entirely pessimistic worldcon will be in Helsinki in 2017, which would be fabulous as I'll probably be living here then. I even bought an SF book today at the store today (Compass Rose, a short story collection by Ursula K. Le Guin) which doesn't happen very often these days (first one this year).

		<a name="6034312"></a><div class="comments">Oh, and because I would hate the sun to set on the debate between anotherpanacea and eriko, I want to note that they are, as far as I can tell, arguing passionately with each other, while sharing the same position. I got really confused by their debate, and had to go back to reread to make sure I wasn't completely misreading what had been said. In case others shared my readerly thickitude, I want to untangle the miscommunication.<br>
<br>
eriko: <i>You have no idea how long fannish memory is. Those that withdrew, tried to get off the slate, didn't accept the nomination are all forgiven, but those who didn't? They are going to have a *long* road ahead of them to ever get a rocket.</i><br>
<br>
anotherpanacea: <i>Yeah, we're going to long remember the treachery of Christopher Nolan and James Gunn, I'm sure. Game of Thrones will NEVER WIN ANYTHING EVER AGAIN. </i><br>
<br>
eriko: <i>There are a small number of people who freak out whenever GRRM writes anything that isn't GoT.</i><br>
<br>
Here eriko was talking about the writing Hugos, not the dramatic presentation awards. It's generally assumed that neither Nolan, Gunn nor anyone high up in the media industry have the least inkling about this Hugo kerfuffle. And anotherpanacea was talking about the unlikeliness of the TV version of Game of Thrones, not the book series, which eriko then refers to.<br>
