		<description>Next thing I know I have this 50 ton whale coming right at me, and I&apos;m thinking &quot;Oh my God. Stop, I just saved you.&quot; Yeah, she&apos;s rising up towards me. And I&apos;m just thinking this is going to hurt, and, uh, when she was only inches away from my chest... She stopped. And pushed me on the chest backwards, and then released me, and then kind of pushed again, and then release, and pushed again, and again. And then she swam up right next to me, puts her head up above the water so that her eye was above the water, and then came up and looked directly at me... for what felt like 30 seconds, she just stared...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A-XNP74vlD4&quot;&gt;James Moskito&apos;s account&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...The pupil didn&apos;t move around. She wasn&apos;t looking for anything else. She was just looking at me. You&apos;re in the presence of something that great. It makes you feel small. It, it really was a, a very emotional feeling. You know I wasn&apos;t quite sure what to make of it. But then she went off to the next diver. And did the same thing.  Coming up right next to him. Looking at him really good, you know inches away, eyeballing him. She swam around every diver...

See also the world&apos;s largest, smartest and loudest toothed predators. They can click at a volume of 230 decibels, louder than a jet aircraft on takeoff. Loud enough to see inside you, loud enough to turn you into a bag of broken bone and blood jelly just by clicking at you if they so chose. But they don&apos;t despite all we&apos;ve done to them... Go figure.

An ambitious project is attempting to interpret sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence, then talk back to them

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/could-we-chat-with-whales-180978956/&quot; title=&quot;An ambitious project is attempting to interpret sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence, then talk back to them&quot;&gt;Could we talk with whales?&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinertia.com/news/can-we-learn-sperm-whale-language-researchers-are-using-artificial-intelligence-to-find-out/&quot; title=&quot;So far, according to Live Science, the CETI team has about 100,000 different sperm whale clicks on file. That might sound like a lot, but they estimate that the AI will need somewhere around four billion of them...&quot;&gt;Sperm Whale Language? Researchers Are Using Artificial Intelligence to Find Out&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/iUR6fNZeyy4&quot;&gt;Sleeping Sperm Whales&lt;/a&gt;

The findings showed that sperm whales around the world practice this vertical sleeping posture &#8212; sleeping on one breath from 6 to 24 minutes at a time -- infrequently spending only about 7 percent of their time asleep, which is less than any other mammal spends, according to the study.

And to conclude, here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/L3G_KUkjFds&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Radiolab: The World&apos;s Smartest Animal&lt;/a&gt;. It recounts a judged by experts contest to determine which animal is the smartest. So just to recap, the contenders were the crow, the slime mold, the sperm whale, the chicken, the raccoon, and the marsupials. And the winner according to the audience was, well, you guessed it.</description>

		<description>Sperm whales are the very best animals on the planet and it&apos;s glorious to have a post I can point people to when they doubt me. Thank you!</description>

		<description>Sometimes I wonder if the whales are reassessing us. What do they remember?</description>

		<description>What a fascinating set of links.

I heard a story (probably fifteen years ago? no idea where) about a dolphin trainer who was working with two animals on synchronized tricks. There was a routine, but the animals were able to switch up the order of events within the routine based on verbal cues: now do the tail-walk, now jump through your hoops, and so on.

At the end of the routine, the trainer liked to say &quot;surprise me.&quot; The two dolphins would apparently go underwater for a moment, then surface and do a trick from their routine. Still synchronized, with both animals together, but not the same trick from surprise to surprise.

If the way that whales exchange cultural information isn&apos;t a syntactical language, it is something equally interesting.</description>

		<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bartley?wprov=sfti1&quot;&gt;James Bartley (1870&#8211;1909) &lt;/a&gt; was probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; swallowed by a sperm whale. (It&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AkjTGCrLvAU&quot;&gt;a whale of a tale&lt;/a&gt;, though.)

A sperm whale &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; ram and sink the whaleship &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_(whaleship)?wprov=sfti1%20https://maps.apple.com/?ll=-0.683333,-118.000000&amp;q=Essex%20(whaleship)&amp;_ext=EiQpAN5V393d5b8xAID4//9/XcA5AN5V393d5b9BAID4//9/XcA%3D&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1820, inspiring Herman Melville&apos;s novel &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick?wprov=sfti1&quot;&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1851) and Nathaniel Philbrick&apos;s non-fiction book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Heart_of_the_Sea?wprov=sfti1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Heart of the Sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2000).</description>

		<description>&lt;em&gt;I heard a story (probably fifteen years ago? no idea where) about a dolphin trainer who was working with two animals on synchronized tricks. There was a routine, but the animals were able to switch up the order of events within the routine based on verbal cues: now do the tail-walk, now jump through your hoops, and so on.

At the end of the routine, the trainer liked to say &quot;surprise me.&quot; The two dolphins would apparently go underwater for a moment, then surface and do a trick from their routine. Still synchronized, with both animals together, but not the same trick from surprise to surprise.&lt;/em&gt;

I recall a similar anecdote about a marine park (turn, spit, curse) where there were two dolphins, each with their own repertoire of tricks.  During one show the trainers noticed that they were both running a little sub-par: the one whose trick was bringing up three rings for the bottom of the pool on their nose came up with only two, the other one -- who did the tail walk -- only got about half as  far, etc.

After the show they discovered that the night before a new handler had mixed the dolphins up and put them each in the other&apos;s enclosure by mistake.  No one had noticed before the show and so the dolphins had each been called on to perform the other&apos;s repertoire.  Solely through their observations of what the other had been doing, each dolphin made a fair effort at it.</description>
